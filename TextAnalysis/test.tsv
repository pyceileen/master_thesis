Torricelli also insisted that he had not done any unusual favors for Chang, who first turned to senator in for help in winning repayment of some he said he was then owed in failed business deal with North Korean government	3.0
Your acceptance on loan from Mr Chang of bronze statues eagle and bronco buster for display in your Senate office under your office's policy of accepting loan of home state artwork was not consistent with Senate rules governing such loans, evidenced poor judgment, displayed lack of due regard for Senate rules and resulted in violation of Senate Gifts Rule and, consequently, violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate rules	2.6
Your failure to act to prevent acceptance of or to pay for gifts of earrings from Mr Chang to individuals your sister, employee and friend in your home at Christmas on mistaken belief that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under circumstances, evidenced poor judgment, displayed lack of due regard for Senate rules and resulted in violation of Senate Gifts Rule and, consequently, violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate Rule	2.67
A photograph of candidate standing in his Army uniform next to his mother is shown, then advertisement shifts to McCall talking about education, while images of candidate looking at computer screen with small child and of him surrounded by children appear	3.0

The New Jersey Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned death sentence of Leslie Ann Nelson, transsexual gogo dancer who killed police officer and investigator with AK rifle	2.5
Justice James R Zazzali and Justice Virginia Long said in septemberarate opinion that in addition to reasons given in majority opinion, also written by Zazzali, they believed death penalty would constitute cruel and unusual punishment because of Nelson's history of emotional disturbance	2.8

But he ignores emissions of carbon dioxide, main global warming gas	2.7
We also agree that law needs streamlining	3.0
poor judgment	2.4
Finally, committee appeared to have discounted Torricelli's contention that he was not responsible for expensive earrings that Chang had given as Christmas gifts to his sister, Stern and Balaban	3.1
The analysis, which was assembled from banking and credit records, incometax returns and congressional financialdisclosure forms, showed by March of , Torricelli's cash expenditures were more than , in excess of cash he had generated from checks and automaticteller machines, official who has reviewed document said	3.0
Pascoe said, Only then will New Jersey voters be able to decemberide Torricelli's fitness for office	3.11
Enclosures	3.0
To say that they could not have done otherwise is bold lie by Moore's critics	2.6
Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill vacuum with completely false ideas	2.7
Moore clearly states that before he came to Flint , Heston gave interview	3.14
After Flint rally comes brief TV interview with Heston, where he is asked about Kayla Rolland again, clear evidence that local media in Flint raised questions about NRA's presence , then inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch, entirely ignored by critics of film, who also mentions Heston's presence as notable, and refers to immediate reactions of people from all over America , gun ownersgroups who, according to him, reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children, much like spanking advocates react aggressively when antispankers to case of child being killed or severely injured by beating	2.3
In poor areas, highly profitable drug business obviously is often seen as last resort	2.5
Never mind that Taliban continued selling opium in spite of deal	2.86
Statistics are Moore's weakest point, and it is surprising that his critics do not dwell on them longer	2.9
That's because they know all too well that Moore is correct: The United States have far greater homicide rate both gun and nongun than most other first world countries	2.5
That's right I could buy as much ammunition as I wanted, in Canada	3.3
If Moore simply chose not to show how he revealed his identification to salesperson, there is nothing fraudulent about that	3.0
Similarly, main motivation for crusades beyond promise of wealth was that Christians were supposedly being slaugusthtered and had to be saved	2.36
His next project has working title Fahrenheit : The temperature at which freedom burns , and he intends to launch it shortly before next US presidential election	3.11
After all, same kind of PR blitz was started against previous recordholding documentary: Roger Me by Michael Moore	2.89
This text is in public domain	3.0
It is no more so than any other successful documentary of last decemberades	3.0
In interview with Wall Street Journal, linked from your site, employee claims that gun would have been normally picked up at another dealer	3.0
There is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about bank scene	3.0
This is perhaps criticism repeated most often, and it also most inaccurate	2.86
First, actual quotes from film are often reproduced incorrectly	2.56
I guess I do not see that specific connection because missiles that you are talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us	2.6
Moore is not from Colorado his question is generic, not meant to refer specifically to Lockheed Martin plant in question	2.88
However, critics of Moore have cleverly ignored McCollum's response and presented Moore as spreading lies about Lockheed plant	2.7
The visual of billboard and narration is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie events together, when in reality, it is quite obvious that he does it to septemberarate introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver	2.83
I should know	3.0
Just saying it seems I have more life now then you have and we know how little I get out!	2.6

Dear Ms LastName	3.12
Find nearby hidden gem and start planning your next weekend or family vacation with all superlative guides	3.6
You can spend lifetime in New York City and miss out on remarchkable abundance of green space throughout metropolitan area	2.6
And in New York state there are even more adventures, great paddling destinations from Long Island to Adirondacks	3.2
Ants themselves rely primarchily on chemical information taken in through their antennae, and to mimic this, Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting stalks with which to both interact with other ants who may be surprised to find ant without antennae and take in chemical information	3.0
Such robot would allow for both longterm studies of antrobot interactions and studies of taskswitching in robots	3.25
Returning successful patrollers have even greater effect on foraging activity: foragers will not leave nest unless patroller returns Gordon, , and rate of foraging in colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into nest Gordon Greene, ; Greene Gordon,	3.14
Midden seems to be marchked in some olfactory way, since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species Gordon,	2.82
All of these chemical receptors will be arranged in array on pair of chemical stalks, with of each type of receptor per stalk	3.0
These will be located in different places: sprayer for successful patroller pheromone will be located on rear at base of Antie, corresponding to glands that researchers believe ants drag along behind them to marchk returning paths, while successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on skirt	3.0
The Behavior	3.0
Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil	3.0
The orientation and distance should be calculable by polarization pattern according to system set up by Lambrinos, et al	3.0
Innest navigation will be function of temperature, read by Antie's thermometer and light source	3.2
Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails: it will need to track trails left by successful patrollers, and localize source of foododors and middenodors	3.1
When both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously, Antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether detected object is nestmate	3.0
In order to perform both of these functions, Antie will need subroutine to explore in zigzag fashion, as harvester ants do Gordon,	2.88
Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as function of gene whose expression changes between young and old ants, and this is easily emulated using clock pulse counter in Antie's CPU that will count its age since last boot	3.0
The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate escape maneuver when their inputs pass certain threshold of stimulation, and bump sensors will, when depressed, also initiate escape function	3.0
Antie would use system for processing input from its polarization compass based on compass designed by Lambrinos, Moller, Labhart, Pfeifer and Wehner in , consisting of photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers	3.0
The difference of their logarithmized signals would be returned to Antie, who will use simultaneous model to navigate returns to nest: Upon each exit from nest, Antie will take single o scan of sky, and will orient itself according to analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization patterns perceived later	3.0
This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia	3.0
Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America: The Rediscovery of Language and Identity	3.1
In addition, there exists complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity; Nasa, for example, divide themselves into traditional, modern, and new	3.0
The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not Indian enough ; it embraces use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples Jackson :	2.7
Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing marchks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm nature of their indigenous identity , and is in turn linked to interaction of Spanish and their native languages	3.0
The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms indigenous group; concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing selfdetermination in eyes of Colombian government requires emphasizing differences	3.0
An emphasis on preserving, rather than practicing, native culture arises: indigenous authenticity is maintained by sustaining knowledge of traditional practices and beliefs without fully embracing them on daytoday basis Gow and Rappaport :	3.0
Humans, in process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others	2.89
In reality land ownership rights were exclusive right of Spanish, resulting in modernday malappropriation of land ownership in hands of descendants of Spanish colonialists Warren , Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers	2.8
It therefore often invokes banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse	2.91
A main concern among panMayanists is reversal of longseated inferiority complex of Mayan people; despite their position as majority within Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marchginalized on fridge of society	2.86
While repartimento was originally used to repress indigenous groups, it is now used to support them: resguardos, or communally owned plots of land, are granted to communities	3.5
Mayans gained formal recognition in as majority population in precursor to peace accord; by its government floated referendum on indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in Colombian constitution Warren :	3.27
So Bush administration can keep claiming that we are safer now, under their policies	3.0

Harmonic Structure and Form	3.2
As Example shows, chords are moreorless in duple meter and with hiccup occurring in measure	3.1
Note that initial G is pickup to section in C , which fills in wholetone descent from E to C with intervening fourth	3.0
E , furthermore, is not convincingly established as dominantfunctioning tone at all	2.9
Hence, measures constitute bass progression BE D B; same stepwise descent E D occurred in first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged	3.0
transformation in rhythm and contour of second headmotive of firsttheme ,	3.0
Wilson,	3.0
The second section of development is in C which is sometimes spelled D	2.9
Although C major chord in measure , preceded by A major V in measure , suggests C as tonal center, tonality is not strongly established until measure	3.0
The third section of development takes trombone motive from transition between first and second sections of exposition shown in Example , transposed to begin on F, and turns it into fugato sequence, reproduced in Example	3.0
In recapitulation of this theme, shown in Example , first chord is Fmajor chord, and A is replaced by A in melody	2.91
The abbreviations FTG and STG stand for First Theme Group and Second Theme Group, respectively	3.0
While tonality in this piece and in Bart's music in general is quite different from its classical interpretation, we find that harmonic structure is at least analogous to standard sonataform structure	3.1
Bart has often applied tonicdominant relationship to pitchclass and its tritone partner, and even admits to using that as compositional framework in his fifth string quartet	2.9
The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of main sections of movement, in fact, it is third movement that draws its thematic material from this section, but harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of entire piece	3.0
The pentatonic set here is exclusively pitchclass set, and its incarnations throughout movement are devoid of any connotations associated with pentatonic scale	3.0
Example shows true dominance of perfect fourth; set created is set derived by stacking fourths	2.9
If we begin from final D and ascend circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain entire set presented in this example	3.0
What exactly is debate between colorlessness vs color and more specifically can black and white be considered noncolors?	2.9
Wearing black and white also marchked distinction of labor between men and women and in highly rigid and segmented society, wearing of different colors seemed most obvious way to do so	2.9
Above all, it is believed that expanse of literacy and printed word, mainly newspaper, had profound effect in influencing choice of black and white	3.33
The explosion of mass production and printing allowed for plethora of colorful advertising and consumer goods which came to be known as kitsch	3.33
Greenberg continues by saying, Kitsch, using for raw material debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility	3.0
Kitsch is epitome of all that is spurious in life of our times	2.9
The predominance of color at expense of drawing is usurpation of relative over absolute, of fleeting appearance over permanent form, of physical impression over empire of soul	2.89
It is neither grey white, nor vory white, but pure white	3.0
We have superceded both'brown' of decemberadence and classiscm and'blue' of divisionism, cult of blue ky, gods with green beards and spectrum	3.2

For these reasons black and white have been placed at top of hierarchy of colors	3.1
