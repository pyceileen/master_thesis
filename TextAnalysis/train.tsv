Fore of mint said high price for coin was reached because it is of kind, it is beautiful and it has great story	3.6
because it is of kind, it is beautiful and it has great story	3.8
The coin was only double eagle that has ever been legally offered for sale, and its Maltese Falconesque history only recently came to light, thanks to documents unearthed during legal battle over its ownership	3.2
In , it was deemed that all gold and silver U S coins would bear depiction of eagle, but gold pieces were issued only after gold rush boom in	3.12
They were called double eagles because their face value was twice that of original gold piece	3.11

It went underground until it came to Fenton in	3.0

Following are excerpts from findings of Senate Ethics Committee's report on Sen Robert G Torricelli's dealings with David Chang:	3.0
Your acceptance of television and stereo CD player upon payment from David Chang of amount you understood to be cost to Mr Chang, rather than fair marchket retail value, evidenced poor judgment, displayed lack of due regard for Senate rules and resulted in violation of Senate Gifts Rules and, consequently, violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate rules	2.5
The Ethics Committee was unconvinced	2.7
troubled by incongruities, inconsistencies and conflicts, particularly concerning actions taken by you which were or could have been of potential benefit to Chang	2.6
Continuation of personal and official relationship with Mr Chang under circumstances where you knew that he was attempting to ingratiate himself, in part through pattern of attempts to provide you and those around you with gifts over period of several years when you and your Senate Office were taking official actions of benefit to Mr Chang contacting United States Government officials, writing letters to foreign government officials and involving Mr Chang of his representatives in situations where you were meeting with officials of foreign governments evidenced poor judgment	2.6
The committee has also considered that principal source of allegations against you is David Chang, witness whose credibility has been called into question by Department of Justice, United States district judge and his own conduct	2.8
In court documents, government noted that Chang could not be trusted	2.6
On May , , Mr Chang was convicted of attempting to corruptly persuade witness to give false testimony, conspiracy to violate federal election law and violations of federal election law	2.9
After evaluating extensive body of evidence before it and your testimony, committee is troubled by incongruities, inconsistencies and conflicts, particularly concerning actions taken by you which were or could have been of potential benefit to Mr Chang	2.78
Therefore, committee expresses its determination that your actions and failure to act led to violations of Senate rules and related statutes and created at least appearance of impropriety, and you are hereby severely admonished	2.4
Further, committee notes section c of Senate Gift Rule concerning anything which is paid for at marchket value or returned as well as your commitment to pay for any item which committee might conclude were in violation of rules, and has further concluded that you must pay Chang amount sufficient to bring total to fair marchket retail value of TV and CD player, as well as fair marchket retail value of earrings given to individuals at your home, with appropriate interest	2.9
The committee criticized Torricelli for maintaining personal and official relationship with Chang under circumstances where you knew that he was attempting to ingratiate himself, in part through pattern of attempts to provide you and those around you with gifts over period of several years	2.8

This second commercial is first in H Carl McCall's campaign for Democratic nomination for governor and will be broadcast upstate in major broadcast marchkets, and on cable in New York City, starting today	3.0
His resume is American dream,	3.3
They show him as Army lieutenant, at his swearingin as state senator, as ambassador to United Nations, surrounded by children as New York City school board president, and at other jobs, leading up to his current position, state comptroller	3.1
The action then shifts to him in office, speaking to camera, as words Experience	3.0

A male voice says, Time Magazine called his life American dream	3.11
Carl McCall, Army lieutenant, state senator, ambassador to United Nations, school board president, Citibank vice president, and of most effective comptrollers in New York history	3.25
The candidate says: I grew up poor with single mother	2.86
She said education's sledgehammer	2.5
It can open doors to opportunity	3.5
That's what education did for me	3.2
As governor, I'll make sure that every kid in New York has same opportunity I had, to get good education	3.3
This advertisement is long on introductions and short on claims of merit	2.86
Thus, most of facts presented are matter of record	3.0
And Time magazine actually called his resume, not his life, American dream, but it also followed that up with reference to his life, saying he was of children and raised on welfare	2.88
The advertisement attempts to make several points and reach several different constituencies	3.2
For one, it counters high name recognition of Andrew M Cuomo, McCall's opponent, by offering voters straightforward introduction to candidate, emphasizing his long list of highlevel jobs in both public and private sector	3.0
It also emphasizes leadership, important campaign issue after Sept	3.17
At same time it gives McCall chance to intertwine his bootstraps story with broader issue of children and education, priority of many Democratic voters	2.89
The court, vacating Nelson's death sentence for second time, ruled on grounds: that jury could have been confused by instructions on verdict sheet and that prosecutor made improper accusations in his closing argument	2.8
Nelson, , had been only woman of people on New Jersey's death row	2.6
The ruling, which does not affect Nelson's guilty plea, sends case back to trial court for resentencing	3.0
The state attorney general's office has not decemberided whether to seek death penalty again, spokesman, Peter Aseltine, said Tuesday	2.9
The court upheld sentence of another death row inmate, Robert O Marshall, convicted of arranging murder of his wife at picnic area on Garden State Parkway	2.7
In its to decemberision in Nelson case, court showed continuing uneasiness with death penalty, as it has done even since adopting voluminous set of review procedures in to govern capital cases	3.0
New Jersey has not had execution since	2.89
Zazzali and Long had expressed similar reservations in June when court overturned death sentence of Thomas J Koskovich, who was when he killed pizza deliverymen in ambush	2.43
The majority opinion Tuesday said court would impose higher standards in capital cases when reviewing prosecutors' conduct and possibly ambiguous jury instructions	3.1
While all members of majority found instructions to jury on weighing aggravating and mitigating factors to be confusing, of those justices wrote in partial dissent that prosecutor's statements in his summation about defense's expert witnesses were within bounds of acceptable argument	2.88
The committee did not confirm some of most serious allegations, including Chang's claim that he gave Torricelli tens of thousands of dollars in cash	2.6
of court's members, Chief Justice Deborah T Poritz and Justice Peter G Verniero, did not participate in Nelson case because both are former attorneys general	3.0

The New York Times said in editorial for Wednesday, July :	3.0
The committee said it had weighed fact that Torricelli's principal accuser in case had been Chang, witness whose credibility has been called into question by Department of Justice, United States District judge and his own conduct	3.1
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt describes himself as America's leading Arab ally	3.0
Yet his antidemocratic behavior is embarrassment to Washington and affront to his own people	2.8
The latest example is Monday's resentencing of Saad Eddin Ibrahim, sociologist and human rights activist, to years in prison for his efforts to register voters, monitor elections and report attacks on Egypt's Coptic Christians	2.4
Ibrahim, who holds dual United States and Egyptian citizenship, is years old and ailing	3.0
Ibrahim's harsh punishment sends chilling message to Egyptians yearning for more accountable and tolerant society	2.7
That is especially true of State Security Court that ruled in this case	3.0
Nor is it likely his sentence would have been reaffirmed if Mubarak believed that convicting American citizen for promoting democracy and human rights might jeopardize his own standing with Bush administration and annual American subsidy that keeps his government afloat	2.8
That aid bonanza was granted to reward Mubarak's predecemberessor, Anwar Sadat, for signing peace treaty with Israel	3.33
Washington has never demanded good governance and democracy from Cairo in return	2.4
In recent months President Bush has spoken of need to promote democracy in Arab world	3.2
But so far he has pushed only with Palestinians	2.88
It is time to extend this policy to Egypt	3.0
It is country with long and glorious history, substantial middle class, peace treaty with Israel and large quantities of American aid	3.22
Under Mubarak it has squandered economic and diplomatic opportunities and relentlessly stifled political debate	2.71
Its official media are awash in antiAmerican and antiSemitic propaganda	2.5
The State Department and American officials in Cairo have issued diplomatically phrased protests of Ibrahim's trial and sentence	2.9
This is entirely insufficient	2.5
What is needed is message delivered personally by Bush and other top officials not only about inexcusable treatment of Ibrahim but of contemptuous approach to democratic values	2.5
In May, that judge sentenced sentenced Chang to months' imprisonment for obstructing justice and making , in illegal campaign contributions to Torricelli's Senate campaign	2.78
The New York Times said in editorial for Wednesday, July :	3.0
Responding to wave of public dismay over first designs for rebuilding Lower Manhattan, Gov George Pataki has sent word that it is time to go back to drawing board	2.6
It is right message, sent while it is still early enough to do something constructive about disappointing quality of work so far	2.43
The governor, like Mayor Michael Bloomberg, now seems committed to creating better mix of uses for ground zero, and hour community in Manhattan's downtown	3.25
While rethinking plans will delay original rebuilding schedule slightly, it does not need to stall progress if governor keeps pressure on Lower Manhattan Development Corp	3.0
and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey	3.0
New York can not afford to have gaping hole that mocks city and its process for rebuilding what was destroyed	2.6
Renegotiating that issue with World Trade Center leaseholders should begin immediately	3.0
Opening process to other designers, both here and internationally, will help septemberarate this urban plan from ordinary	3.0
The city also needs to begin openly discussing what happens underground, in particular with transportation network	3.0
At this point, planners have focused on shortterm repair of PATH and subway lines, with mediumrange proposals being shopped in Washington that could untangle disorganized web of subway lines downtown	3.2
But at time of Chang's sentencing, judge, Alfred M Wolin, also said businessman had cooperated closely with federal investigators, providing them with information that was material and credible	2.9
Within next few weeks Lower Manhattan Development Corp	3.0
and Port Authority should offer some bigger ideas about how to connect downtown area better to rest of region	2.8
Lowering West Street alongside World Trade Center site and building park or esplanade on top is another option that has been popular with those reviewing first public proposals	3.2
But it would be expensive, and governor, mayor and their friends in Washington will have to look at longrange ways to pay bill	2.82
Pataki's recent remarchks are sign that he understands how central rebuilding of Lower Manhattan will be to his own political legacy	3.0
Now he needs to follow through with action, to keep demonstrating that his core concern is coming up with best possible plan, not simply keeping issue on hold until after this fall's election	3.12
The New York Times said in editorial for Wednesday, July :	3.0
A debate on how to make yearold Clean Air Act stronger and more efficient instrument is surely long overdue	3.0
But Bush plan falls well short of only other credible proposal on table, bill sponsored by Sen James Jeffords, Independent of Vermont	2.8
Like Jeffords, president calls for substantial reductions in major pollutants nitrogen oxides that produce smog, sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and mercury	2.8
That is huge omission	2.5
Even for pollutants he addresses, Bush's timetable is too leisurely	3.0
He aims to reduce all by percent by	3.1
The Jeffords proposal would make same sizable reductions by	2.9
Finally, Bush proposal would roll back key provisions of existing Clean Air Act that Jeffords would keep	2.8
Bush argues that regulatory mechanisms he has in mind for reaching Clear Skies' goals, chiefly marchketbased emissions trading scheme, will be so effective that need for many existing rules will disappear	3.3
The ethics committee has power to punish lawmakers with sanctions ranging from public or private letters of admonition to censure or expulsion	2.88
This page has long embraced emissions trading as essential tool for reducing pollution at manageable cost	3.1
But some regulations, aimed at specific regional problems that nationwide trading alone is unable to address, can not lightly be abandoned	2.75
Among these are rules governing emissions that limit visibility in national parks, and rules governing pollution that drifts eastward from Midwestern power plants	2.9
Indeed, Bush has already made clear his intention to roll back of most important of these regulations, provision known as new source review that compels utilities to install modern pollution controls whenever they significantly upgrade older plants	3.11
The Bush bill, as written, is not way to get there	2.5
In Torricelli's case, it acted without conducting full investigation, saying case had been exhaustively scrutinized by federal authorities	2.9
A lawyer for Chang, Bradley D Simon, said Tuesday night that he was disappointed that ethics panel had confirmed only handful of gifts he said his client had given Torricelli, and that panel did not deal with what he said were actions by Torricelli to thwart federal investigation	2.6
This matter was far more serious than what committee found,	2.57
This matter was far more serious than what committee found, Simon said	2.75
According to government officials involved in inquiry, Ethics Committee received vast amount of information from federal investigators, some of it under court order issued in March	2.9
The committee's letter did not mention Chang's reported gifts to Torricelli of , Rolex watch, about dozen Italianmade suits and , antique grandfather clock	2.89
Your actions and failure to act led to violations of Senate rules and related statutes and created at least appearance of impropriety,	2.38
Your actions and failure to act led to violations of Senate rules and related statutes and created at least appearance of impropriety, Democrats and Republicans on committee said in letter to Torricelli	2.5
A government official involved in inquiry said that evidence of those gifts was either incomplete or subject of conflicting accounts by different witnesses	2.8
The committee confirmed Torricelli's claims he had made partial repayments to Chang for gifts: largescreen television and stereo compactdisc player	3.2
But it said senator had showed poor judgment by failing to reimburse him for full marchket value of gifts	2.8
A person familiar with Torricelli's testimony to committee said he had told its members that he repaid wholesale cost of appliances because Chang told him that was what he had paid	2.8
wholesale	3.0
The ethics panel also criticized Torricelli for taking bronze statues on loan from Chang	2.7
The statues, existence of which had not been publicly known before, were displayed in Torricelli's Senate office	3.0
The senator's belief that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under circumstances displayed poor judgment and violated Senate gift rules, panel found	2.6
According to government official involved in inquiry, information reviewed by Ethics Committee also included analysis by federal investigators showing that during period in which Chang claimed to have made numerous cash payments to Torricelli, senator spent thousands of dollars more in cash than investigators could account for from his bank withdrawals and other known sources of income	2.62
A spokeswoman for Torricelli, Debra DeShong, said he had fully accounted for all money he had spent	2.9
Senator Torricelli provided committee with full explanation of sources of income and any funds used for cash purposes, she said	3.0
Even after ethics committee admonished Torricelli on Tuesday night, of his most important political supporters, Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, DS D, continued to defend him, stating that panel had found Chang witness wholly without credibility	2.9
witness wholly without credibility	2.67
Moving quickly to make campaign issue of Senate letter, Bill Pascoe, Forrester's campaign manager, said findings were evidence that Torricelli had undertaken extensive campaign of misinformation and decembereit, and called on him to release sworn testimony he gave to panel	3.0
extensive campaign of misinformation and decembereit,	2.25
Only then will New Jersey voters be able to decemberide Torricelli's fitness for office	2.9
U S Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived here on Tuesday night for meetings with fellow foreign ministers aimed at solidifying second front, in Southeast Asia, in campaign against global terrorism	3.11
But he has had to balance that goal with longstanding concerns about human rights abuses in region	2.89
In meetings on Tuesday in Malaysia and Singapore before touching down in this oilproducing sultanate for days of talks with members of Association of South East Asian Nations, Powell said he repeatedly raised issue	2.9
The Senate Ethics Committee on Tuesday night severely admonished Sen Robert G Torricelli, DN J, saying he had violated Senate rules by accepting and failing to disclose expensive gifts from former contributor to whom he repeatedly gave help	2.5
We still believe strongly in human rights, and that everything we do has to be consistent with universal standards of human rights,	3.2
We still believe strongly in human rights, and that everything we do has to be consistent with universal standards of human rights, he said	3.11

Moore is professional filmmaker he concentrates on maximum impact of each of statements he cites, and to accomplish that effect, uses subtle interludes instead of longwinded introductions	3.0
Not surprisingly, much of criticism of Moore's film is misguided or outright wrong, often vastly more inaccurate than Moore's work itself	2.8
This is common technique, but because conservative readers are not familiar with basics of filmmaking, they believe critics who claim that he is distorting interview	2.9
What he does is standard filmmaking practice	3.0
The same goes for interview which follows	2.91
Moore's critics would expect us to have him quote Heston in his entirety, have him present fully PR that NRA has used to justify its rally in Denver for reasons of balance	2.8
The NRA was fully aware of scandal it would cause through its rally and decemberided to push on because they believed to have enough media support to successfully do so	3.0
They were right	3.4
You claim that there was no way to change location, since you have to give advance notice of that to members, and there were upwards of , , members	2.67
days are more than enough to give advance warning of change in location or date, had NRA really wanted to	2.78
That does not change fact that they did just that	2.8
This is what good documentary filmmaking is about	3.5
And here critics again ignore important evidence:	2.2
When Heston mentions mayor of Denver, crowd boos loudly	2.5
Heston maganimously holds up hand to read mayor's letter only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore request not mentioning at all reasons you have given!	2.5
This booing by crowd, not mentioned with single word in your transcript or your article, shows that crowd was fully aware of controversy they would cause by coming to Littleton after children were being killed there and they effectively said Fuck you	1.7
Fuck you	1.2
The Kayla Rolland case	3.0
The rally took place on October , shooting on February	2.56
Again, standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion:	2.9
It is brilliantly, if unethically, done	2.78
As noted above, from my cold dead hands part is simply Moore's way to introduce Heston	3.0
Did anyone but Moore's critics view it as anything else?	3.0
He certainly does not attribute it to speech where it was not uttered and, as noted above, doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was mastermind decembereiver that his critics claim he is	3.0
Concerning Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland, you write: There is no indication that Heston recognized Kayla Rolland's case	2.9
Even if he did not respond to that part of interview, he certainly knew about case at that point	3.0
Regarding NRA website excerpt about case and highlighting of phrase hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead :	2.7
This is valid criticism, but far from deliberate distortion you make it out to be; rather, it is example for how facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moore's fast pace editing	3.0
His documentary is full of subtle humor, jawdropping dialogue and dark contrasts	3.1
The reason sentence is highlighted is not to decembereive viewer into believing that Heston hurried to Flint to immediately hold rally there as will become quite obvious , but simply to highlight first mention of name Kayla Rolland in text, which is in this paragraph	3.1
Unfortunately, because zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss rest of sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got incorrect impression	2.7
It would have been fair for Moore to out this possible misinterpretation on his website	3.0
However, claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons:	2.7
before he came to Flint	3.0
In excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March	3.0
All in all, it is accurate portrayal of America's gun and violence culture	2.89
If Moore wanted to decembereive his viewers, why would he say this, and show month interview was published?	2.88
b Why should Moore leave words Clinton is on Today Show visible in text, which is necessary to correctly interpret highlighted part?	3.0
I reviewed sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing	2.9
c Both soccer mom interview and sequences showing NRA rally make no effort to distort fact that this rally happened months after fact	2.8
The camera lingers on BushCheney posters, and protestor is quoted as saying that we wanted to let NRA know that we have not forgotten about Kayla Rolland	2.4
You make hysterical claim that interview may be faked on basis that no name is shown for interviewee , but if Moore had faked it, why hell should he put this sentence in protestor's mouth, which directly contradicts conclusion that rally happened hours after Kayla's death?	2.36
It also raises questions about America's foreign policy of recent decemberades, questions which have been all but ignored by Moore's critics	2.8
This makes no sense	2.37
Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold pro gun rally on location of nation's youngest school shooting months after fact, but this sequence of Bowling is without doubt most unfair to Heston	2.5
The claims of deliberate distortion do not hold up when viewing whole scene, though as Hanlon's Razor states, should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence	2.7
The somewhat inept editing of NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions, which is unfortunate, but Moore's critics have no interest in viewing matter fairly	2.8
In any case, at no does Moore make false statement, in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is full of lies	3.0
Having created desired impression, Moore follows with his Heston interview	3.3
The Heston interview is at very end of movie	3.0
On your webpage, you state that Moore's resolution is questionable	3.0
Moore's resolution is questionable	2.6
After all, early in movie he discards possibility that playing violent video games and watching violent flicks can cause violence because Canadians like, and Japanese positively love, those	3.0
These people do not feel need to express sympathy, or to think about ways to avoid such incidents, but they feel need to assert their rights and to look for quick, simple answers as Busch states, gun owners wanted to hang child from highest tree	2.18
This is all not mentioned by critics of Moore's movie, who claim to be objective	2.9
Moore answers simple question how could scene have been filmed with simple answer: cameras	2.9
From this, you construct obscure conspiracy of reenactment : For all we can tell, Moore could have shouted'Hey!' to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left	3.0
For all we can tell, Moore could have shouted'Hey!' to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left	3.11
'Hey!'	3.12
Even if your reenactment theory is true and I see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask people involved in filmmaking for their opinion , this itself is not unethical, and you have no evidence whatsoever that Moore has done anything unethical here, just like you have no evidence that Moore has unethically removed parts of interview	2.8
You use standard filmmaking technique as basis to construct bizarre conspiracies which sound plausible to gullible reader, without ever providing any evidence for implicit or explicit claims of fraud and distortion	2.73
Animated history of US Of course cartoon is highly oversimplified, and most critics consider it of weakest parts of film	2.8
But it makes valid claim which you ignore entirely: That strategy to promote gun rights for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was way to uphold racism without letting openly terrorist organization like KKK flourish	2.5
Did th century NRA in southern states promote gun rights for black people?	2.83
I highly doubt it	2.73
But if they did not, of their functions was to continue racism of KKK	2.6
This is key message of this part of animation, which is again being ignored by its critics	2.37
If violent movies and violent videogames can not cause violence then how can newscasts about violence do so?	2.37
Buell shooting in Flint	2.6
You write: Fact: The little boy was class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with pencil, and had fought with Kayla day before	2.5
Fact: The little boy was class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with pencil, and had fought with Kayla day before	2.57
This characterization of as pencilstabbing thug is exactly kind of hysteria that Moore's film warns against	2.2
It is typical rightwing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict Republican mindset	3.0
The kid was little bastard, and parents were involved in drugs case closed	2.3
But why do people deal with drugs?	2.88
Because it is so much fun to do so?	3.5
It is equally well known that socalled war on drugs begun under Nixon administration is failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America world leader in prison population both in relative and absolute numbers	2.5
This is faulty generalization	2.44
But real cause here are not drugs themselves, but poverty and war on drugs	2.6
Had boy's mother not been shipped to welfare to work program, she might at least have had some time to spend with her son	2.2
If, as Moore implies although never states as fact , video games and violent movies are relatively harmless, it does not logically follow that all types of media presentation are harmless	2.8
Once again, your emphasis on little boy as thug confirms Moore's and Busch's assertion that people wanted to hang child from highest tree instead of looking at real causes	2.4
That's because while there is socalled war on drugs, there is no war on poverty	2.5
Poverty is frequently portrayed as natural, and poor in America are seen by conservatives as VCRowners who are just too lazy to work	2.5
In reality, what Moore describes here is most vivid example of what can only be called wage slavery I have ever seen, to detriment of families	2.6
It is notable that Wall Street Journal's reaction to this segment of film was even more dismissive than yours: It called Moore's claim preposterous	3.0
, probably most comprehensive among many rebuttals of Oscarwinning documentary	3.1
How could he even think about blaming poverty and forced labor programs for anything bad that happens?	2.37
Taliban and American aid	3.0
After September attacks, it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away fact that US government gave dollars to new evildoers du jour	2.57
Never mind fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding Taliban as early as in May	2.86
Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of Taliban's violent enforcement of ban on opium poppies	2.7
Never mind that in regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute aid ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage	3.0
Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraq's Saddam Hussein	2.9
There is huge difference, for example, between playing game like Quake and listening to radio broadcast that tells you that your family will be killed unless you take action to kill others now	2.3
Never mind that this is all documented on Michael Moore's website about film	3.0
Gun homicides	2.2
His main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data, his second mistake is that he does not cite his sources and, as you correctly out, he probably uses different reporting methods for different countries	2.6
A good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on relatively neutral guncite com website	2.8
The gun homicide rates for countries Moore mentioned, according to guncite, are: Japan: per , EnglandWales: per , Germany: per , Australia: per , United States: per ,	2.9
Critics fail to credit Moore with not making same mistake that some gun control advocates make concluding that gun ownership leads to violence	2.63
In fact, Moore mentions several counterexamples, and more such counterexamples can indeed be cited	3.0
It is intuitively obvious that guns do not actually cause violence but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make violence that is committed more deadly	2.5
It is second intuition which gun rights groups like NRA seek to obscure using fraudulent data by likes of John Mary Lott	2.9
If these causes were addressed, gun ownership in United States would not be problem but also unnecessary ; just like it is in Switzerland	2.9
Canada ammunition purchase	3.0
You write: Bowling shows Moore casually buying ammunition at Ontario Walmarcht	3.0
look at what I, foreign citizen, was able to do at local Canadian WalMart	3.22
He buys several boxes of ammunition without question being raised	3.0
Canadian officials have pointed out that buy is faked or illegal	2.6
Once again, you fail to distinguish between regular film editing and faking word which Canadian officials have never used; for such distortion, Moore would have been boiled alive by his critics	2.5
His claim that it is possible to purchase ammunition in supermarchkets is independent from that claim	2.78
If anything, it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with having more mixed ethnicity	3.0
While this can in part be explained with his age and mental condition, if he is unable to defend interests of NRA, he should not be their spokesman	2.9
In this case, Hanlon's Razor can be applied to Heston he is probably not racist, but incompetent	2.9
If Heston makes himself look like fool, that should hardly be blamed on Michael Moore	2.67
Conclusion	3.0
You write: Bowling for Columbine is dishonest	2.7
Bowling for Columbine is dishonest	2.1
It is fraudulent	2.3
To trash Heston, it even uses audiovideo editor to assemble Heston speech that Heston did not give, and sequences images and carefully highlighted text to spin viewer's mind to wrong conclusion	2.6
None of this is true	2.44
What is true is that Bowling for Columbine is diamond in small world of big screen documentaries, that shines brightly and illuminates often misunderstood aspect of American culture	3.2
It is not flawless diamond hours scene in particular suffers from bad editing, statistics are suboptimal, and Heston gets bit more bashing than he deserves	2.6
Other than towards NRA, movie tries hard to avoid simplistic conclusions, and comes up with some thoughtful answers	3.1
Obviously, media propaganda can incite people to kill	1.9
Had Moore wanted to make propaganda film, he would have used other material: photos from America's Emergency Rooms	3.0
Certainly, Moore is of most talented filmmakers in United States today, and his film fully deserved its Oscar	3.5
The shrill and remarchkably unsuccessful Internet campaign to revoke his award seems to be motivated more by jealousy than by real concerns about film's accuracy	2.5
It is not only highest grossing nonmusic documentary of all time, among users of largest Internet film database, IMDB, it is also highest rated one	3.6
According to LA Times, documentary genre owes huge debt to Michael Moore after Bowling's success, films like Spellbound and Capturing Friedmans were taken seriously and shown in many more theatres than otherwise likely	3.25
It is unlikely, however, that unfair attacks against him will have much of impact	2.25
Moore's hypothesis which apparently comes at least in part from book Culture of Fear by Barry Glassner, also advertised on Moore's website is that constant bombardment with messages of fear can incite paranoia, which itself can lead to violent acts	2.8
Critics have now gone so far as to call for revocation of award	2.67
This is consistent with kind of mediaincited violence described above, and in no relationship whatsoever to theory of video game or music incited violence	2.78
It is no surprise, however, that US and European media do not question their own propaganda of fear	2.75
Moore's second hypothesis is that America's foreign policy may contribute to belief that violence is appropriate means to solve conflicts, hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists	3.0
Children who grow up in wartorn regions are known for having similar views war is perceived as normal part of existence, violence as natural way to solve disputes	2.62
Their chances are small, however, as their arguments rely on polemic, exaggeration and misrepresentation in other words, on same techniques which they accuse Moore of using	2.75
In weaker sense, same message is projected to American children, who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to another, but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media messages about how enemies of freedom are punished	2.6
Moore's film was made before dead bodies of Qusay and Uday Hussein were paraded on national TV	2.6
Americans were gloating over this demented corpse show:	2.4
They squealed like little piggies too, so you will have to make do with'oink, oink, squeeeeeeeallll' for their last words	2.9
'oink, oink, squeeeeeeeallll'	3.5

Americans cheer killing of children, yet wonder why their own children grow up to be more violent than those in other nations	2.29
It is paradoxical notions like this which Moore's film seeks to address	2.91

It is fascinating to watch organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been going on in United States since release of his last documentary	3.25
According to same WSJ interview, Typically, you are looking at week to days waiting period	2.71
A defense of Michael Moore and Bowling for Columbine	2.8
Typically, you are looking at week to days waiting period	2.7
Moore's detractors have sometimes extended those days to several weeks, contradicting bank's own estimate	3.0
The bank does exactly what it advertises: It hands out guns from its vault to those who open account	2.7
The silly criticisms of scene obscure real obscenity of situation: bank handing out guns to its customers, higlighting utter laxness of how Americans deal with deadly weapons and love of firearms that borders on religious	2.43
The LockheedMartin interview	3.0
So you do not think our kids say to themselves, gee, dad goes off to factory every day he builds missiles	2.9
These are weapons of mass destruction	2.37
What's difference between that mass destruction and mass destruction over at Columbine High School?	2.7
In time of simpleminded patriotism, loud, clear and dissenting voices like Mr Moore's are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced, partially through well funded public relations campaigns, partially through conservative grassroots propaganda	2.22
McCollum understands it this way otherwise he would protest against plant being mischaracterized	2.75
Even Lockheed did not believe public to be that gullible	3.0
In response to Moore detractor, McCollum wrote: Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in country produce weapons to support defense of U S, we make no weapons at Littletonarea facility Moore visited	3.1
Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in country produce weapons to support defense of U S, we make no weapons at Littletonarea facility Moore visited	3.0
Of course, critics have conveniently ignored fact that Lockheed Martin does supply weapons of mass destruction to US military, and that company is nation's largest military contractor	2.9
As Moore correctly points out, it is bizarre for society to openly embrace production of destructive weapons, but on other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence children learn by imitating adults	2.8
Yes, Moore makes this through slight exaggeration by moving with camera through LM plant but he makes no incorrect statement	3.0
Denver NRA meeting	3.0
Critics like yourself claim that Moore has massively distorted evidence to support his that Charlton Heston has effectively insulted victims of Columbine tragedy by holding rally in Denver shortly afterwards	2.62
It is perhaps of his most famous quotes, shown on national TV even here in Germany	3.14
It tells viewers: Aha, this is person we are talking about	3.3
It is Moore's way to say: Viewers, meet Charlton Heston, gun nut extraordinaire	3.0

Diagram of polarizationopponent unit described by Lambrinos, et al	3.0
The unit takes in polarization levels through polarizationsensitive photodiodes and feeds them into logarithm ratio amplifier, which returns difference of logarithmized signals from photodiodes	2.86
The evector heading returned from polarizationsensitive photodiodes , follows cosfunction	3.0
These stalks will need to have receptors to measure nalkene levels present in another ant's cuticular hydrocarbons, which research indicates is marchker for harvester ants of nestmate's current task, perhaps because hydrocarbons are altered in dry sun, causing different ratio of nalkanes to nalkenes and presence of branched nalkanes in hydrocarbon profile Wagner, et al, , as cited in Gordon Greene,	3.0
Antie's stalks would also have receptors for hydrocarbons themselves, which research shows indicate to ants whether another ant is their nestmate Arnold, et al, , as cited in Gordon Mehdiabadi, , receptors to detect food, and receptors for types of pheromones: those released by successful foragers returning with food, those released by successful patrollers returning to nest, and those marchking piles of trash as midden	3.0
For purposes of this proposal, I will assume that nest maintenance and food processing ants have marchked midden with particular pheromone	3.0
I propose here theoretical construction and programming of robot hereafter referred to as Antie that will be able to infiltrate red harvester ant nest, switching between foraging, patrolling and midden work behaviors	3.0
This technique, described by Ishida, et al , has been shown to improve chemical plumetracking abilities of robots	3.0
The wires will lead back down through stalk to onboard PC	3.0
Finally, Antie will have tactile sensors on its grippers to analyze pressure being exerted on gripped object	3.5
These sensors will be of type patented by Peterson, et al Patent , , , and will feature several layers of electrically insulating and parallel flexible conductive rods arranged such that exerted pressure may be measured in output voltage	3.1
These will correspond to muscles of ant's mandibles, which provide sensorimotor feedback to ant when grasping objects	3.0
A table of sensors and their relation to ant's sensory system is provided below	3.1
Table of sensors and their relations to ant	3.0
The red harvester ant lives in hot, dry deserts, building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain	3.0
The ants forage for more than different varieties of seeds, many of which do not grow in desert Gordon, , where only few varieties of small shrubs, small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow Gordon,	3.1
Introduction	3.0
Motors	3.0
Antie's motors will allow it to move around and interact with its environment and fellow ants	3.1
There will be individually operated motors to drive side wheels in lieu of legs	3.0
simultaneously operated motors will open and close grippers, emulating grasping power of ant's mandibles	3.0
A third motor will lift and lower grippers, allowing Antie to raise and lower gripped items as ant would by raising and lowering its head	3.2
small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from appropriate sacs	3.0
Antie will not spray different pheromones depending on its task, on assumption that its time in sun will alter its hydrocarbons enough that its tasks will be recognizable to other ants	3.11
Other insects and creatures, including other species of ants, are present in desert, but red harvester ants seem to be relatively undisturbed by these animals Gordon,	3.0
Almost all motor output will be direct function of sensory input as indicated in following section	3.0
Antie will have hybrid software architecture: subsumption hierarchy will be responsible for switching between behaviors, but many subbehaviors will operate on schema basis	3.0
Pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible, and where appropriate, different subroutines running on schema basis will be marchked	3.1
Common Behaviors	3.0
A few subbehaviors will be necessary for more than behavior	3.0
The following global variables will be used throughout pseudocode, and are compiled here for ease of reference:	3.0
Background	3.0
Though fights sometimes do break out with other red harvester ants from different nests, intraspecies interactions tend not to be aggressive Gordon,	3.0
Because of this, I will ignore other ant species in design of Antie, and will not create fighting behavior	3.0
Common behaviors will include forward cruise and turning mechanism, procedures to determine orientation towards nest and distance from nest when outside, innest navigation, escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into, object identification and gripping, generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following, and identification of other ants	3.0
Science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass Turing Test for years	3.1
The Ant Robot	3.0
Ants of this species are of types: breeding ants queens and drones and sterile female workers	2.9
These behaviors will often be used in other subroutines running on schema basis, and when combined with forward cruise function, should cause robot to move at angle	3.0
In order to orient itself toward nest while navigating outside, Antie will need to determine which direction nest is in and rotate toward that heading, and also how far from nest it is at its current location	3.0
Antie will therefore have polarization function that will return compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to nest, and distance function that will return shortest direct distance	3.0
We may assume that this first function will return direction in degrees, positive or negative, and that second function will return distance in centimeters	3.1
Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal, as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during breeding season, which occurs but once per year	3.0
The first function might look something like this:	3.0
To exit, Antie will seek high temperature until photoreceptor reaches threshold of stimulation indicating sunlight, and to get deeper, Antie will seek lower temperature	3.0
The code may look something like this:	3.0
The behaviors of sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories: brood care, nest maintenance, patrolling and foraging	3.0
This void function will be called nestEnter , and will take in no inputs	3.0
To avoid bumping into things including other ants , Antie be provided with escape function	3.0
Each of Antie's bump sensors will cause robot to rotate different amount, and sonar will cause it to rotate degrees in opposite direction	3.0
Regardless, this will be very simple function	3.0
I will include example:	3.0
Little is known about brood care, as this occurs only in deepest regions of nest and observation would generally require destruction of nest	2.88
Because this function responds to sensors on Antie's around sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it, this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds	3.09
Before picking objects up, however, Antie will need to identify them	3.0
This object detection process will be activated when front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated	3.1
Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell	3.0
The code may look something like this:	3.0
Nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in deeper regions of nest, but sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of nest midden work occurs close enough to surface to be observable	3.11
Once object has been identified, Antie may grip it and lift it	3.0
A simple void function grip taking in no inputs will tighten grippers until certain threshold of pressure is reached, at which grippers will be lifted for carrying	3.0
A void function release will perform this same action in reverse	3.0
Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using sensors on antennae stalks has been successful in with analog robots in past Webb, , regardless of potential problem of airflow causing disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones	3.0
As partial control for problem of imprecise sensing, function will perform analysis of array information coming on from Antie's sensors on each stalk	3.0
The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is leftIP or rightIP	3.0
Antie will use chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg's aggressive type vehicle described in his book Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology, as this was found through series of experiments by Russell, et al to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models	3.0
Because same general algorithm will be followed for localization of all chemical traces, I will provide pseudocode for only generic subroutine	3.0
Patrolling and foraging, too, occur for most part outside of nest, and have therefore been studied extensively ex, Schafer, et al, ; Gordon, et al, ; Gordon, ; Gordon,	3.0
Proposal for Red Harvester Ant Robot: Colony Infiltration and Task Switching	3.0
For purposes of calls later in pseudocode, I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow , findFood , and findMidden	2.9
All are void and take no inputs	2.7
The final common subroutine will be for identification of other ants	3.1
As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with nonnestmates, Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest	3.0
The code will be similar to object identification subroutine and may look something like this:	3.0
Using these basic common behaviors, more complex behaviors may be coded	3.0
Red harvester ants do not retain task throughout their lifespan, but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for colony Gordon,	3.1
Research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as function of age ex, Ingram, et al, and partially as function of interactions with other workers ex, Schafer et al, ; Gordon, ; Greene Gordon,	3.1
Younger ants work more inside nest, and older ants work more outside nest	3.09
As result, I will model main behaviors in order that they are to be engaged in	3.3
Midden work, which consists of moving dirt between inside of nest and outside, will occur first; patrolling, which involves shorter overall amount of time spent outside, will occur second; and foraging will be final behavior	3.1
Finally, I will discuss main method encoding task switching between these behaviors	3.0
The midden work behavior will be Antie's default initial behavior	3.14
It will be initiated in morning by sunrise, and will continue until outside temperature reaches oC, at which all red harvester ants must return to nest	2.9
As previously stated, midden worker must identify midden, grasp it, and carry it to surface, depositing it halfway down mound before returning to collect more midden	2.9
A program encoding this behavior might look like this:	3.0
These behaviors each present different puzzles to ant and to modeler, though there is some overlap, particularly with navigational problems	2.88
Nest patrolling will involve leaving nest, roaming around on nest mound for few minutes, and reentering nest	3.14
This behavior will be implemented in parts, with taskswitching algorithm based on age	3.0
Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy Moron, et al, , and that taskswitching is partly genetically controlled by switch in gene expression as individual ages Ingram, et al,	2.88
Harvester ants display preference to wander in familiar territory, though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests' territories Gordon,	3.0
In case of midden work, Antie must be able to identify garbage, grasp it, carry it out of nest, and deposit it about halfway down mound before returning to repeat process ad infinitum or until stimulated to switch behaviors	3.0
To control for this behavior, Antie's explore subroutine will display preference for exploration in places where there is low gradient of nestmate pheromones	3.1
This model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day, even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths Gordon,	3.0
The code may look something like this:	3.0
Patrolling may be divided into distinct subbehaviors, nest patrolling and trail patrolling	3.0
Trail patrollers will go much further, until food sources are found, and will then orient towards nest and create trails for foragers to follow	3.0
An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit nest at proper time in morning and wander about for bit on nest mound, presumably taking measurements of temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for other ants to exit	3.0
A general site of food is all that patroller need find; foragers will dig through sand for food	3.1
Code for patrolling behavior might look like this note that part is on schema basis :	3.0
The integers nestpatrolage and trailpatrolage will represent ages at which it is appropriate to switch to these tasks	2.9
Perhaps level of degradation of nest patrollers' cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into sun and heat acts as indication of outside conditions to foragers, who may then, upon smelling returning patroller, be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside nest	3.0
The final behavior, foraging, will involve extra subroutine that will employ algorithm designed by R	3.0
Andrew Russell to localize object through sand based on chemical plume	3.0
This will emulate digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds, and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest	3.0
This algorithm will keep track of last intensities of desired chemical input and compare them	3.0
The code for this, adapted from Russell's paper, might look like this:	3.0
Foragers will follow trails marchked by patrollers to their conclusion before collecting food to bring back to nest, even if more tantalizing food presents itself in their path Gordon,	3.0
To address this, strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that foragers do not stop to collect food too soon	3.0
The code might look like this:	3.0
An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit nest, wander around searching for food sources, identify food upon discovery and return to nest to show foragers where food is	3.12
Because midden work behavior is Antie's initial default behavior, I will not address task switching to midden work	2.9
Infiltrating insect societies, however, is much simpler	2.89
This is thought to be accomplished by deposition of chemical marchkers from gland on abdomen that patroller drags along ground on her return route to nest that foragers may then follow Gordon, ; Holldobler et al, , as cited in Webb,	3.0
Activated foragers form queue to exit nest and exit at steady rate	3.0
According to Schafer's, et al model of forager activation, every time successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit, fraction modeled at of inactive foragers joins queue	3.0
For purposes of modeling Antie, I will assume that switches between these behaviors are permanent, irreversible and partly function of age, with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers	2.88
The code to model this taskswitching might look something like this:	3.11
Antie will be fully autonomous, situated and embodied agent, infiltrating red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about hypothesized rules of these ants' behaviors and their taskswitching thresholds, but also about combination of complex behaviors into single autonomous system with ability to switch between behaviors as necessary	3.2
In addition to following these trails to food, foragers must also be able to identify food, grasp it and carry it back to nest	3.0
Biomimetic robots have long been rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers, and complex robots that can switch tasks as situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as for obvious practical applications of robot swarms, such as on battlefield and standard building maintenance	3.0

The thermometer will be located on rear of robot to keep it out of way, and will detect and input to robot outside temperature in degrees Celsius	3.0
Harvester ants do not exit nest when outside temperature is above degrees Celsius Gordon, , and ability to use temperature gradient will enable innest navigation	3.0
Antie will also be equipped with photoreceptor located in middle of top of its chassis corresponding to ant's eyes	3.0
These will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in morning and shutting off behaviors at night: patrollers first poke their heads out of nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night Gordon,	3.12
No robot has yet been constructed, however, that could pass undetected within colony of red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus; nor has robot managed to pass undetected in society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them	2.9
The bump sensors and sonar will form skirt around Antie to keep it from colliding with other objects	3.1
The sonar will correspond to ant's limited optical object detection ability, and bump sensors will allow robot to detect collisions	3.1
The polarization compass will consist of polarized light sensors placed at and degrees from center front of Antie, respectively, that will orient Antie towards desired polarization pattern	3.1
These sensors would correspond to cells in ants' eyes sensitive to polarized light, and research has shown that many insects, including ants, do navigate using path integration system synthesizing input from polarization compasses and from sort of odometer Labhart, et al,	2.9
This should be sufficient to return Antie to nest, given accuracy achieved by Lambrinos, et al and relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside nest before returning	3.0
However, it reflects on greater level both desire of many Mayans to assimilate, as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility, and belief among general population that Mayans do not require septemberarate bill of rights as they are covered under general rights already in constitution Warren : ,	3.0
Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with Mayan language itself: those who speak Spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak Mayan alone England :	2.9
Nonetheless, in legislature passed law of national languages, which while reaffirming Spanish as official language, recognizes importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion	3.0
Within panMayan movement, there remains desire to maintain linguistic diversity: some view reduction of their language to status of dialect devalues their unique identity and place in Mayan world; however, despite differences over standardization, panMayan movement itself is largely cohesive	3.0
An example is Tukanoans: while considered single ethnic group , they maintain distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy, in which members of language group must marchry into another Jackson :	3.2
Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating worldview marchkedly removed from that of dominant Western culture	3.1
Indigenous cosmology, or cosmovision , is difficult to translate into Romanticized languages; it maintains concept of culture, defined as form of behavior resulting from permanent harmonic relationship with Nature Gow and Rappaport : and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with Western modes of thought	2.9
Conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed, often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and nongovernmental organizations	3.0
The differences between Western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within revitalization movements themselves: question of embracing Western law and discourse is continually grappled with	2.9
Language plays complex and integral role in development and redefinition of identity, particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by dominant other for as long as that of indigenous peoples in Latin America has In particular I will examine divergent yet remarchkably parallel cases, that of Maya in Guatemala and Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia	3.11
Customarchy law in Colombia contrasts with Western law as it maintains different perception of casual relationships: tying back to indigenous concept of harmony, crimes are viewed as imbalances in community's harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate crime, but may have influenced accused to do so	2.7
When punishment often public and corporal in nature is carried out, group feels effects as whole	2.57
Shamans often sit with criminal as he fills his sentence, sharing in their ordeal	3.0
Rappaport Once punishments are completed, criminal is seen as rehabilitated, having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order, and is welcomed back into community Gow and Rappaport : , Rappaport :	3.0
Translation of law into native languages has proved to be difficult task, as Western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision	2.9
The translation of Colombian constitution sparked development of neologisms, as goal of translators was not to provide direct translation of constitution, but to recapture its spirit in native, rather than Western discourse Gow and Rappaport :	3.2
This provides second interpretation of law distinct from that of Spanish Colombian culture, and in turn interpretation aligned with native ideology for cabildos to follow when governing Rappaport : ,	2.9
Translation fulfills another vital role, as it is employed in rediscovery of indigenous identity itself	3.25
Workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge, distancing them from Western influences that have invaded over past centuries	2.88
The Guambiano history project charts native history as outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature; Mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten Rappaport :	2.9
This attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within modern context and native language use	2.9
Difficulties arise, however, as conflicts between traditional and modern and native languages and Spanish develop	2.8
Many native peoples in Colombia are monolingual Spanish speakers, raising question of practicality of indigenous language use	2.9
The authenticity of modern Nasa, who are often metropolitan Spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots, is brought into question by traditional, who speak Nasa Yuwe and lead rural existence Rappaport	2.8
In Guatemala fact remains that Spanish is gateway to social mobility; years of conflict and refugee status have established desire to leave rural way of life for updated urban one, and those literate in Spanish have tools to do so	3.1
Illiteracy and poverty is associated with Maya; thus there is conflict between desire to recapture unique Mayan identity via language and need to improve living conditions, which most often occurs under Spanish influence	2.89
A further complication is necessity of establishing authentic Indianness , both in eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and outside Spanish culture	2.9
Politicians make of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly, even if they are more at home in business suit and speaking Spanish; indigenous identity has become calling card to extent that at times it appears to be caricature of itself	2.9
Efforts towards development, then, can not endanger traditional culture and values, for fear of losing cultural legitimacy Jackson :	3.0
There develops duality in native culture; for example, many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside classroom	3.1
This intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed	2.9
In Colombia, legal successes have often come about due to Colombian government's recognition of political viability of rhetoric of indigenous rights; by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win trust of people who view government as incapable of protecting them from ongoing civil strife, and by giving them blocks of land they hope that indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where government itself has not Jackson :	3.0
Regardless of ulterior motives behind their legal status, indigenous peoples in Colombia now possess rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws Jackson :	3.0
Conflicts arise due to internal differences and everpersist problem of defining indigenous identity and authenticity in pluralistic linguistic environment	2.8
Works Cited	2.9
The effects of Spanish colonialism are both farreaching and deeply embedded in both countries	2.86
of most prominent, lasting influences is that of land grant system Initially Spanish government attempted to instate encomienda system, in which conquistador maintained direct control over indigenous peoples and their land	2.9
This was in turn replaced by repartimento; natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way inferior of Spanish, providing labor and taxes as demanded	2.9
The impoverished plight of native populations was first recognized by Marxist movements of early th century	3.29
Those were first to articulate necessity of affirming independent identity of indigenous populations; previously, both left and right maintained belief in indigenous assimilation into dominant Spanish culture	3.1
However, they also claimed that they were part of larger group, working class, whose poverty was direct result of American imperialism; therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into workerfriendly Jackson :	3.11
In Colombia this resulted in civil war between Liberal and Communist parties and Conservative party	2.4
A truce established between Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet demands of Communists, who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response	2.4
This process leads to development of what can be broadly termed culture: group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing distinct identity, discernible from that of those outside them, those who do not belong	3.09
This resulted in persecution against Mayans, who make up about of overall population In both counties, guerrillas were often associated with native peoples; in many cases there were coalitions, but in others guerrillas merely used remote, inaccessible villages as hideouts	2.6
In Guatemala over villages were destroyed, , Mayans were killed, and over more were displaced	2.2
The main guerrilla force was demilitarized in with establishment of peace accord Warren :	3.2
By s need to assert cause septemberarate from general left was seen, and indigenous rights movements formed Warren : , Jackson :	2.9
Central to these was question of indigenous identity:	3.0
PanMayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around Mayan language; despite local dialectical differences, it is seen as unifying force behind diverse Mayan people	3.1
Most still speak it in various forms, and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize language are producing coherent, modern version of Maya England : ,	3.1
PanMayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity; it largely avoids specifically political overtones, instead concentrating on development of reemerging Mayan culture England :	3.0
The popular left, however, continues to see rhetoric of ethnic rights as politically viable tool	2.62
The PanMayan movement thus benefits from lasting influence of popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing often negative attention of government England : , Warren :	2.9
Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things clothing, food, lifestyle choices	3.0
This results in part from ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism: Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility, whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior	2.9
PanMayan leaders therefore seek to develop return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance, language of power and prestige England :	3.0
By doing so they hope to inculcate among Mayan peoples renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse dogma of Spanish superiority	3.0
Colombia, in contrast, has no unified panIndian sentiments; indigenous population is small fraction of overall population, fractured entity divided by region and language	3.0
Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed: ONIC poses itself as sole panIndian group, yet lacks legitimacy in eyes of many indigenous peoples Jackson : ,	3.0
The CRIC, which focuses on language development and renewal, is primarchily representative of Nasa peoples Jackson :	3.0
Whereas Mayanists benefit from single main identity, those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between various ethnic groups Jackson :	3.0
This reflects desire among peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities, both from Spanish Colombian population and each other	3.3
The command of language, while not affording guaranteed access to community which speaks it, is often key to gaining entry	3.12
A major success in Colombian saga is revamped constitution of , which includes section on indigenous rights, as Congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups Gow and Rappaport :	3.12
Central is return to old land grant system stemming from repartimentos of colonial era along with judicial sovereignty	2.9
They are ruled by cabildo, local governing boards formed of community leaders Gow and Rappaport :	3.0
The return to customarchy law reflects substantial shift in indigenous identity:	3.0
no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse, communities are forced to assess efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of modern era	3.1
In turn communal identity can be formed around language; it is used as focal around which group gathers	3.1
The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with desire of Colombian government to codify law, and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature Gow and Rappaport :	3.0
The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to failure of Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of	2.6
True, USA has not suffered successful major attack since , but this does not mean that we are safer	2.6
The terrorists could strike any time they choose, through any of numerous loopholes so well reported in our media	2.8
This website and everything on it is in Public Domain, so you may use it freely, even without attribution	3.0
But they have chosen not to attack, perhaps because they are waiting to produce effect even greater than attacks, so they do not appear to be losing strength	2.6
What could be more spectacular than attacks?	2.8
Nuclear!	2.9
All of our frantic preparations may have had some effect in preventing smalltime casual attacks, but they can not stop serious planned attack, any more than mere door lock can stop serious robber who really wants to get into your house	2.5
But this claim is merely feelgood propaganda, intended to keep neocons in power	2.9
It can not withstand clearheaded scrutiny	2.7
The fact is, Bush policies have failed completely even to diminish terrorism, much less defeat it	2.0
By trying to stamp out terrorism by killing terrorists, Bush and Israel have made things infinitely worse for us: more dangerous, not safer	2.1
And proof that Bush has failed may come at any moment, explosively, with big successful attack here in USA	2.6
May God help us all	2.5
WHAT IS TERRORISM?	2.5
TERRORISM is systematic use of violence to create general climate of fear in population and thereby to bring about particular political objective	2.9
We believe that any terrorist act is crime against humanity and against will of God, because it deliberately intends to injure and kill innocent people	2.4
years have now gone by since September th attacks in , and terrorism is far greater threat to us now than it was then	2.5
Our purpose here is to NEUTRALIZE TERRORISM by removing motivation for it	3.1
Without motivation, terrorism will quickly die down, like plant without water	2.9
We completely reject idea that terrorism can be defeated by brute force, because brute force radicalizes moderates, and they then join terrorists	2.8
Brute force has failed in Palestine, and it is failing in Iraq	2.8
We try to be evenhanded in opposing all terrorism, although we recognize that greatest terrorist threat in world today comes from radical Muslims who falsely believe that Allah approves of their criminal behavior against Israel, The United States, Russia, India, Philippines, Australia, and others whom they falsely believe to be waging war against Allah	2.8
And secondgreatest terrorist threat comes from several countries, mainly Israel, who sometimes resort to terrorism themselves, claiming selfdefense, as they desperately try to prevent further attacks by radical Muslims	2.6
In all of these cases above, if radical Muslims would cease their attacks, all terrorism on both sides of every dispute would quickly end	2.7
The AntiTerrorist Undermining The Motivation For Terrorism	2.9
The number and severity of terrorist attacks worldwide has increased dramatically, as has number of active terrorists	2.3
The moral and religious theories which support terrorism are quite faulty and erroneous	2.7
They need to be identified and attacked	2.2
If terrorist loses faith in righteousness of his acts, he is less likely to perform them	2.9
EXAMPLE : Terrorists Offend Allah	2.6
EXAMPLE : Terrorist Murderers Insult Allah, Bring Shame To Islam	1.9
EXAMPLE LATEST AND BEST! Framed Below : Qur'an Forbids Terrorism	3.2
In every case of terrorism, we will find some kind of legitimate underlying grievance	2.9
If we eliminate legitimate grievances, we have eliminated much of motivation	3.1
Is this negotiating with terrorists or trying to appease terrorists, as some IsraeliNeoCons would try to say?	2.7
No	2.7
It is simply recognizing realities of human motivation, right or wrong	3.1
To deny reality, as IsraeliNeoCons do, is to invite disaster, as they have done	2.6
May God help us all	2.7
Blessings to you	3.73

Because ASPCA and thousands of animals we help every year need all friends we can get!	3.2
As person who cares about animals, you are probably anxious to know what happened to Astro	2.75
A neighbor reported Astro's plight to ASPCA and our Humane Law Enforcement officers went to investigate	2.71
When our officers arrived, Astro was too weak to even stand up	2.63
The officers knelt down slowly, speaking gently to emaciated dog	2.67
Then they saw it	3.1
Astro was wagging his tail	3.78
He was barely moving	2.6
but yes poor, sick dog was saying	2.38
Welcome, friends!	3.8
The dog weighted only pounds less than half of what dog his size should weigh and he had several infections	2.11
But with firstrate medical attention and tender care from ASPCA staff, he slowly got well again	3.7
Stories like Astro's are all too common	3.0
Every day, ASPCA gets reports of animal cruelty, abuse, and neglect	2.11
Every day, our officers rescue animals like Sammy, monthold kitten who was deliberately thrown from highrise window by teenagers	2.6
In world where cruelty is common, animals like Sammy and Astro desperately need friends like you	2.7
That is why I have written to you to ask you to support ASPCA today	3.0
Our vital anticruelty efforts are just part of ASPCA mission We also find loving adoptive homes for rescued animals provide firstrate veterinary care through our Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital offer lowcost spay and neuter programs for cats and dogs reach out to children, teachers, and parents through our Education Programs	3.14
His belly was empty	2.6
And we do not stop there	3.2
At least Astro could drink water from puddle near stake he was chained to	2.7
Since ASPCA was founded in as America' s first humane society, ending cruelty has been our primarchy goal	3.5
Today, over years later, scope of problem is greater than ever	2.36
The ASPCA urgently needs your help to push back tide of violence against animals	2.44

Let me tell you exactly what is at stake and how this could set dangerous precedent: First of all, you might wonder why blackbirds are not benefiting from Migratory Bird Treaty Act's prohibition against actions that cause intentional harm	2.5
Just imagine finding your favorite hiking trail or birding area littered with dead birds among hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting and innocent creatures who were unlucky enough to consume lethal doses of slowacting poison spread in fields miles away	2.14
So they applied for right to spread poison as Dart of scientific experiment to learn whether lowering population of blackbirds by poisoning them will reduce sunflower crop loss	2.9
scientific experiment	3.0
Can you believe it?	3.14
experiment	2.9
And if death of birds does not prove their theory and show reduction in crop loss they will likely seek right to kill even more birds next year!	2.6
prove	3.0
It's time to tell USDA, in no uncertain terms:	3.0
Because USDA's slowacting pesticide takes days to kill, its victims will likely fly many miles from poisoned fields, before falling to ground	2.2
Meanwhile, blackbirds are not only birds threatened directly by poison	2.7
In all, birds on Federal threatened or endangered lists and birds on Audubon's WatchList of imperiled species could be found in these killing fields	2.78
We simply can not afford to let government repeat mistakes of past and operate this deadly and uncontrolled experiment on wildlife	2.7
I can assure you that thousands of Audubon Petitions can make difference just as they did in successful battle against adverse wetlands proposal few years ago!	3.6
But today's battle is we must win to block dangerous experiment that would begin to erase years of steady progress eliminating pesticides and other harmful chemicals from our environment	2.88
That's why I hope you will also agree to help even more by making taxdeductible gift to support this crucial initiative and all of Audubon's vital conservation work to protect birds, other wildlife and habitat	3.0
And with donation of or more, you will receive FREE Birdfeeder in appreciation for your concern	3.3
I'll make sure your gift is put right to work in our efforts to:	3.2
Win ban on USDA bird poisoning	3.3
Gain strict enforcement of wildlife laws	3.0
Ensure wildlife programs are based on sound science	3.0
Conserve America's remaining grassland habitat	3.0
And Audubon will draw upon its centurylong track record of highly effective conservation work to make real difference in other key areas:	3.1
The U S Department of Agriculture!	3.2
Audubon protects birds	3.5
Your help will be instrumental to our bird conservation work: designating Important Bird Areas to protect vital habitat maintaining WatchList of bird species near endangered status www audubon org birdwatch and engaging citizen participation in vast BirdSource database of North American bird trends	3.12
With your help, Audubon will remain committed to wildlife laws and regulations that are well funded, properly implemented, and strongly enforced	3.14
In fact, USDA has plans to spread poisoned rice in sunflower fields throughout northern Great Plains targeting migrating blackbirds and threatening nearly other bird species	2.2
Audubon establishes and protects wildlife refuges and sanctuaries	3.46
Audubon is truly making difference for wildlife refuges everywhere	3.7
I'm outraged	1.63
Wetlands are not only crucial to wildlife they also help purify our drinking water and prevent billions of dollars worth of flood damage	3.1
Your gift today will help us reach our goal to restore acres of irreplaceable wetlands	3.3
Audubon educates public	3.3
Teaching Americans particularly young people how to become better stewards of our environment is of best investments that you and I can make for wildlife	3.4
That's why we are expanding our network of Audubon Centers to reach children and adults in every corner of nation	3.33
And of course, your support will enable Audubon to stand ready to act whenever wildlife crisis emerges like USDA's bird poisoning proposal that I'm asking you to help us defeat today!	3.1
So let me urge you to do your part by supporting group that San Francisco Chronicle calls of America's most respected and influential conservation organizations	3.0
First, sign and return your Petition to Secretary of Agriculture immediately, to decemberlare firm and resounding NO!	2.7
NO!	2.0
to USDA's bird poisoning plan	2.5
And I also hope you will take second important step today, by supporting Audubon's vital conservation work with generous taxdeductible gift	3.2
Thank you	3.63
Very truly yours,	3.5
John Flicker President	3.0
P S Your gift will help us save birds, other wildlife and their habitat for future generations to cherish	3.66
and I think you will be, too!	3.5
And in thanks for your gift of or more, you receive FREE Birdfeeder	3.2
it is almost unthinkable that program this reckless could be implemented in view of tragic impact that poisonous chemicals and pesticides like DDT have had on wildlife and people	2.5
Supplies are limited so please respond today!	3.1
Thanks to help of caring and concerned people like you, Audubon won temporary halt to this planned killing last spring but USDA's plans could be up and running for next blackbird migration, unless we act now	3.2
It's already won prestigious National Magazine Award not once, but times	3.6

Paul Wilson describes transition from Introduction to Exposition as quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated,	2.7
Wilson,	3.0
but it is in fact this motivic relationship that ties them together and creates rather smooth transition	3.1
The Exposition	3.0
As mentioned, first theme, beginning of which is reproduced in Example , contains head motives: first is tritonespanning ascent that appears in first measure, and second is iteration of interval cell , , that appears in second through third measures	3.0
Bart describes form of first movement as more or less regular sonata form	3.0
While presence of perfect fourths that was so prevalent in Introduction is clear in latter, former does not employ perfect fourth in its formation	3.0
Rather, this motive is smallscale representation of tonicdominant relationship of tritone partners, specifically F and B, that is basis for harmonic structure of this movement	3.0
Rhythmically, we have dissonance between melody, which follows written meter, and accompanying chords in bassoons, horns and lower strings	3.0
Example reproduces chords, and Example rewrites them in meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern	3.0
This is in strict metric dissonance with triple meter of melody with its own hiccups occurring in written measures	3.0
While that does not seem to be meaningful assertion, it is perfectly accurate: movement is in sonata form, but there is introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of movement not unheard of in Mozart sonatas , and recapitulation presents themes of exposition in reverse order	3.0
We have already mentioned that first theme group is in F, this is made clear from onset, both in melodic line and by F minor triad that occurs on downbeat of measure	2.9
While material occasionally departs from this F in measures , these departures are all subordinate to prolonged F	3.0
E is tonal center for measures , although it does not appear as strong bass note until measure	3.0
Measures contain mostly chromatic descent from C to E , where E is anticipated throughout as goal tone for bass	3.0
Immediately following arrival of E in bass, C D is established as tonal center for final transition to second theme	3.14
The trombone motive in measures , shown in Example , is subject of fugato section in part of development, although its importance is downplayed here	3.0
This motive also contains intervallic cell of second head motive of first theme in form of G C BE with addition of some passing tones , in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths	3.0
While strong VI motion from measures does carry tonal implication of dominanttonic, such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context	3.0
The passage from measures is centered on E and pentatonic set from opening of exposition is transposed down whole step , but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function	3.0
Rather, we can consider this occurrence of E as middlegroundlevel wholetone descent that foreshadows structural descent to E at measure that is represented in Example	3.0
In measures , bass descends FE D C, which might seem to support C's functioning as structural dominant	3.0
However, as previously mentioned, C acts as fake dominant that in measures actually functions as upper neighbor to B, true dominant	3.0
The descent in measures in fact participates in farce by projecting descent ending on C, which makes eventual reinterpretation of C and descent to B stronger	3.1
The second theme is tranquil and harmonically simple, which is in stark contrast to first theme	3.14
B dominates as tonal center from measures with little or no harmonic motion away from it	2.88
The backwards recapitulation is technique that Bart employs frequently because of formal symmetry it creates	3.0
Measures are in E , with bass notes in harp, and measures are in D	2.9
A intervenes between E and D in measure , another instance of wholetone being filled in by fourth	3.0
The return to B in measure is also filledin in this way by F in measures	3.0
Paul Wilson points out that i n substituting for F within analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this as crucial interior center of movement	3.0
i n substituting for F within analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this as crucial interior center of movement	3.0
In our terminology, this is at which B is unequivocally established as structural dominant	3.0
The Development	3.18
As mentioned, development is divided into subsections	3.0
In Example , entire development section is represented by exactly pitches, and indeed each subsection is associated with of these pitches as its tonal center, none of these pitches is involved in structural wholetone descent	3.0
As Paul Wilson states, development is, for Bart's music, developmental in relatively conventional way ; themes from exposition are expanded and modified, and tonalities other than those expected arise	3.18
is, for Bart's music, developmental in relatively conventional way	3.0
For example, fifth string quartet	3.0
The only slight abnormality, though it is certainly not unheard of even in classicalperiod sonata movements, is emergence of new theme in second section of development	3.0
Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on transformation in rhythm and contour of second headmotive of firsttheme ,	3.0
Before beginning analysis of any piece by Bla Bart, must first decemberide to what degree tonal analysis will be used	3.0
Also see Bart's comments on that Bart,	3.0
there is no intervallic relationship between motives, and it is not clear what elements of motive remain when rhythm, contour and interval content are changed	2.88
Furthermore, this section, being middle section of movement, upholds formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme	3.0
The first section of development, measures , begins with big Dminor chord which immediately establishes D as tonal center for section	2.86
Although it moves to E minor in measure , it returns to D minor in measure , which suggests that E is upper neighbor prolonging D	3.0
Example shows diagram of form of movement; symmetry is apparent within sections following introduction	3.0
The passage beginning at measure , shown in Example , can be considered to be theme of this section, and is development of second head motive of first theme	3.0
This motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout section	3.0
This section is reproduced as Example	3.0
The arrival at C was foreshadowed by first measures of development Example , which are almost direct transposition of head motives of first theme to C	2.8
Because of its emphasis here in development section and its position as leading to B in second theme group, we could conceive of C as subdominant in this movement	3.0
As example shows, development section is divided into subsections; first and third subsections draw their thematic material from first theme group, and second subsection involves new material not drawn from exposition	3.0
As tempting as this interpretation may be, this observation is relegated to notes section because it constitutes horrible abuse of terminology, there is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms	2.7
The tonal center B is established immediately in measures by strong VI chord progression Example	3.0
As previously mentioned, fugato motive incorporates motion by perfect fourths found in Introduction as well as intervallic cell found in second head motive of first theme	3.0
The resultant set is pentatonic set FB E A D ; entire passage shown in Example remains within this set	3.0
The second instance of fugato section, not reproduced in its entirety but based on subject in Example , is exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C	3.0
The inversion blends seamlessly back into original subject in measure	3.2
The following section measures especially brings out quartal harmonies within pentatonic set, so much so that B is obscured as tonal center which allows A to emerge as goal tone of this section, only to be immediately reinterpreted as leading tone to A that begins recapitulation	3.0
Hence, on either side of middle section of development we have alternation FTGSTGFTG which makes overall form, with exception of Introduction, symmetric	3.0
The Recapitulation	3.1
The recapitulation, as we have seen, presents themes in reverse order	3.0
The second theme is initially presented in A, as part of wholetone descent, and proceeds directly to G, where it is restated slightly modified	3.0
It is worth pointing out that arrival on G at measure is led into by D, which constitutes another filling in of wholestep by intervening fourth	3.0
The A in measure might initially seem to be new tonal area, but it leads to D in measure , which constitutes V chord still applied to G	3.0
Rather than resolve this D back to G, however, Bart shifts briefly to F in measure and leads to E in measure	3.1
E and F are both active throughout entire transition from second theme back to first theme measures which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to F, which returns triumphantly in measure with muchanticipated recapitulation of first theme	3.38
The return of first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such; however, there are some important differences	3.0
Firstly, its initial appearance in exposition had minor flare to it; first chord in Example is Fminor triad, and first notes of Example ascend Fminor scale	3.1
Paul Wilson also discusses inherent symmetry of movement, although his interpretation is somewhat different	3.0
In addition to mode shift, we notice that metric dissonance shown in Examples and no longer appears notice how regular rhythm of accompanying figure is in Example and also that written meter no longer changes	3.1
In other words, piece, in becoming more regular, is beginning to drive towards finish, because of formal structure, recapitulation of first theme also serves as closing section of movement	3.1
Indeed, this section has feel of Coda to it, it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection, and tonic harmony is active throughout	3.1
See Wilson,	3.0
Bart is of many earlytwentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in gray area between tonality and atonality	3.12
While we know from his writings that he often composed with tonal centers and relationships in mind, and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions, by merely glancing at any of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in common practice period is not at work	3.1
Thanks largely to work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have detailed system for analyzing tonal music, their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on atonal side of spectrum	3.2
But if we apply it to music such as Bart's that is in middle area, we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results	3.1
To do so was goal of this analysis of first movement of Concerto for Orchestra	3.0
By applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of tonal realm, we not only find elements of tonality that do remain, but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions	3.1
It is not disputed that Bart's music has great expressive power, perhaps now we can understand why	3.18
References	3.0
Bart's music, although it is often difficult to call completely tonal, never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure	2.88
When we say in F, we do not imply F major or minor, for that matter , majorminor tonal system in general does not apply to this piece, but rather that pitchclass F is tonal center of movement, and acts analogously to tonic in Mozartian sonata movement	3.0
Tonal Structure and Form in Bart's Concerto for Orchestra I	3.0
Using this interpretation, we can map out local tonics tonal centers used throughout movement, as shown in Example	3.0
In this example, barlines divide formal sections of piece Introduction Exposition Development Recapitulation , so we can immediately see that tonic F is not established until exposition begins	3.1
This remains true even with of his last compositions, Concerto for Orchestra, written years before his death in	2.8
See Bart,	3.0
In this particular movement, Bart feigns moving to tonal dominant, C, for second theme before reinterpreting C as chromatic passing tone between D and B, this and other subtleties shown in Example will be explained in detail in later sections	2.9
The graph in Example will serve as of departure for subsequent analysis; while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements, it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced, this graph serves as explanatory goal of this paper	3.0
The Introduction	3.0
As Paul Wilson points out, title Introduzione given to movement as whole seems to apply only to first measures	3.0
The discussion that follows analyzes first movement of Concerto, focusing on tonal structures at play throughout movement	3.0
To begin with, opening motive in celli and basses, shown in Example , outlines pentatonic set and strongly presents C as tonal center	3.0
Indeed, this set can be seen more as byproduct of stacked perfect fourths than generative element itself	2.9
Furthermore, following instances of this opening motive, shown in Examples and , remove any doubt as to motivic importance of perfect fourth, and in turn diminish importance of pentatonic set	3.0
Example transitions from C to F , and adds pitchclass E to pentatonic set of Example , creating set of stacked fourths	3.1
Each note is either approached or left or both by fourth, and structural motion is from F to D	3.0
The overall motion in first measures is C to D , through F ; these are represented enharmonically in Example as D , E and G	3.1
As previously mentioned, this motion constitutes initial ascent to what will eventually be wholetone descent from F to F	2.8
So prevailing structural motion of movement as whole is descending whole step and prevailing melodic motion is usually ascending perfect fourth	3.1
We can connect by noting that descending whole step consists of ascending fourths; indeed, structural wholetone descent is often filled in with intervening fourth	2.9
This motion is exemplified in Example in second theme group mm	3.0
We will also examine to what degree tonal reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in attempt to pinpoint exactly where Bart strays from commonpractice compositional techniques	3.0
, and as we will see, it occurs in other places, though not relevant enough to background structure to be represented in Example	3.0
Each time motion in Examples through breaks from chains of fourths, same sequence of intervals occurs: descending perfect fourths septemberarated by ascending major second , , ; each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in examples	3.1
This sequence of intervals is inversion of those found in second head motive of first theme of exposition, shown in measures of Example	3.0
So although there is no thematic relation between Introduction and main sections of movement, within first measures we can already see structural, harmonic and motivic elements that apply to movement as whole	3.0
The section from measures is centered on E; upon return of D , enharmonically respelled as E , in measure , we see that E acts as its upperneighbor	3.0
This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures however; while there is no clear tonal center for this section, G appears in outer voices in measure , although harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor	3.0
The concluding motive of this section in violins bracketed sections of Example , as well as bass motive of measure ff	3.0
Example , are related to first head motive of first theme, which is shown in first measure of Example	3.0
All of these motives span tritone, which as mentioned is dominant relationship in this movement	3.0
Because of this it is possible to take up any given colors and make them harmonize	3.12
Why in world filled with color do we feel need to purge it from our space?	2.8
The white of walls intensifies color of what is set before them	3.12
It stabilizes and controls forms because it brings to light contours of space	2.9
In white painted room clarity of spatial sensation and disposition was surest and most convincing, all details of form and color of furnishings could be developed undisturbed in front of this background In this form was discovered which was completely convincing in its simplicity and which could be seen as of essential formulas for wall treatment in closed spaces	3.0
In th century it became fashionable for bourgeois women to dress in white, while men dressed in black Wigley	3.0
These distinctions proved certain rational order, only attained by those able to afford of it	2.75
White walls, white clothing, they both require much more maintenance than something colored where stain can merely hide away among other colors	3.0
Crisp whiteness on other hand expresses sort of luxury, and leisure	3.4
White clothing proved that someone was of level of society in which they were not forced to work, for clothing would immediately become soiled if not and thus reason why women who were ones to stay at home dressed in all white, while men who were ones to go out and work wore black, for black did in fact hide stains	3.1
The same goes with white walls, in their impeccability it proved to whoever, that owner could afford to not live actually live in this space, or could afford more simply for upkeep and constant fresh coats of paint	3.0
Both as well were signs of modern age man had reached	3.22
Pure white was de rigueur, partly because of its exciting novemberelty, partly because it emphasized smoothly mechanical texture, and pointed contrast between it and surrounding nature	3.09
The use of white was proof that man had conquered nature	3.29
Ever since dawn of man, human society has evolved in ways which attempt to ultimately control nature	3.0
The use of white and black in dress and architecture also became way of distinguishing oneself from vulgar, normal, lower classes	2.9
Furthermore, with advent of industrialization invention of new synthetic dyes meant that color in dress became democratized for all classes	3.0
Now, anyone could afford to wear colorful clothing and masses began to dress themselves in what once would have been inconceivable to them	3.5
Seeing as color is something of natural world, age old and archaic, washing it away from our lives is ultimate form of rising above physical world	3.1
This simplicity of dress was seen as marchk of modern man	3.11
Other major technologies during age of industrialization also had effect on this preference for black and white	3.0
Photography took over as means of portraiture for bourgeois and upper class and despite fact that it was possible to color photographs, for most part they were left in black and white because it was seen as more natural	3.2
This world was viewed as orderly and relatively uniform, world in black and white	3.14
This led to idea of writing rationality production that confined images, especially images in color, to emerging field of art , which was understood as essential activity but that was essentially unproductive, while it assigned to and orderly world of printed paper role of daily guide to existence	3.0
Intelligent beings have language represented by articulate sounds; organized beings, like all animals and vegetables, express themselves by cries or forms, contour or carriage	3.09
Black and white became symbol for superiority of man's intellect and technology	3.12
This then translated down into world of fashion, as seen with distinction between black and white clothing, as well as art, namely photography but also film and as discussed before architecture and gallery space	3.0
Seeing as since time of Aristotle, form was valued over that of color, arts which did not require color to be enjoyed were perceived to be that of higher form	3.09
Kitsch is product of industrial revolution which urbanized masses of Western Europe and America and established what is called universal literacy	3.3
In order to meet demand of mass marchkets cheap and bright things of little use were made to attract attention of consumers	3.0
Kitsch made cheap what once was truly cultural by way it reproduced it d infinitum	3.0
Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations	2.5
Kitsch changes according to style, but remains always same	3.0
Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money not even their time	2.8
With advent of kitsch came great need for distinction between higher and lower artforms	3.1
Avant guard at time was considered to be true art, while this kitsch was simply pure imitation	2.9
Inorganic nature has only language of color	3.0
Thus said, this along with influence of black and white print perhaps was cause for belief that which was black and white was deemed serious, high art, while that which was colorful was mere rubbish and imitation for lower classes	2.8
Of course during early stages of color film and photography, quality was so poor that it gave cheap look, whereas black and white film really allowed to see light and shadows in images	3.1
For play of light and form was key in demonstrating true art form	3.1
It is by color alone that certain stone tells us it is sapphire or emerald color, then, is peculiar characteristic of lower forms of nature, while drawing becomes medium of expression, more and more dominant, higher we rise in scale of being	3.1
That was what made up essence of image, not artificial, or superficial filling in of form with color	3.09
Color was thought to distract viewer from soul of image	2.9
These beliefs have changed since color technology as tweeked to of being almost better than reality	3.0
Still though black and white is seen as something of more sober tradition	3.0
These non colors allow for appreciation of color	3.2
When something is black and white, it allows mind to fill in and imagine for itself amazing colors that must exist beyond screen	3.0
Many actually complained with invention of color in movies that this stunted mind since was forced to look at garish colors placed before them	2.8
It is for this reason that ultimately use of black and white is seen as more of intellectual process	3.0
Whether it mean going beyond mind or simply purity of non color, use of black and white has been debated over for last years	2.71
Now we have entered era where we are seeing once again more color, but perhaps it is human instinct, to want to surpass and rebel against generations before, so possibly we shall return to state of non color veneration	3.0
Thus is ebb and flow of life	3.0
The world is made up of myriad of colors color gives distinction to our life, it gives flavor and meaning	3.14
In Far East, reaching state of colorlessness is associated with highest state of spiritual being, state of Zen	3.0
What is typical of this sort of ascetism is art of expressing as much as possible using minimum as ideal	3.11
This is apparent through Japanese haiku as well as art of ink painting in both China and Japan	3.0
For them, reaching greatest depths of spirituality demanded expression in its most minimal form	2.91
This reduction of color and expression proved purity artist had reached within himself, it was means of reducing down to essence of thing	3.4
In Elimination of color in Far East, Izutsu explains though how this ultimate state of minimalism can only be reached through appreciation and fine knowledge of color	3.0
This artistic acestism, i e, suppression of externals and reduction of all colors to black and white, manifests its real aesthetic function only against background of highly refined sensibility for colors and their subtle hues	3.1
What would our lives be without color?	2.9
For black and white can only be seen as distinguishing against background of color and for this very reason can assert that both black and white are colors in themselves as noncolors	3.0
It is through absence of color that brings to mind colors that are no longer present	3.1
It is up to mind to fill in blank space	3.0
Without color could not appreciate purity of black and white space	3.18
That is to say, under total absence of color, there is vague reminiscence of all colors that have been killed	2.89
Black and white are consummation of all colors into one	3.3
Black is life; it is infinite possibility of expression and development Black here is not sheer black	3.0
For in it is negation of all colors, all colors are positively affirmed	3.22
It is through these means that finds essence in thing	3.1
In Western society, this purging of color began with rejection of ideals of generations past	2.88
Eliminating color was way of eliminating decemberadence of th century	2.8
Society turned to minimalism as way of cleansing life, representing modernity	3.09
color became moral issue, seen as something sensuous and dangerous in its secondary nature to essence of life and form	2.8
color is associated with Fall from Grace	2.71
It is something which speaks to senses, not mind, it is external and therefore secondary to life	3.0
It deals with body, emotions, not intellect	3.12
It strays from reason in way which it consumes and manipulates life	2.5
We went from times of celebrating color and decemberoration to of minimalism where black and white were placed at front as representations of modernity and ultimate transcendence	3.0
White is seen as representing spirituality, heavens, and light, it is all which is modern, it signifies opposite of carnal nature of color	3.2
It is control of nature, and body and represents modern man	3.29
WHITE is spiritual color of our times, clearness which directs all out actions	3.3
WHITE is color of modern times, color which dissipates whole era; our era is perfection, purity, certitude	2.9
Abolishing color means controlling color	2.7
The white surface exposes color, presents it for disciplining	3.12
It keeps eye on all objects it frames	3.0
But before that, it keeps eye on itself, watching its freshly laundered and neatly folded fabric for stain of color	3.0
colorlessness is not natural, and thus proves man's superiority over this world	2.8
On other hand, we need color in order to distinguish black and white	3.11
Just as those from Far East, purity of white implies what has been washed away and thus makes white glitter even more	2.88
White and black stand out because of color, and color stand out because of white and black	3.0
They are linked intrinsically together, can not go without other	3.0
White is setting for color	3.0
In mosque for example, architectonic effect of its white garment is assisted by strategic use of color: All these things are clothed in majestic coat of whitewash	3.1
The forms stand out clearly; impeccable construction displays all its boldness	3.1
What is significance for this preference for black and white when it comes to high art?	3.0
At times high stylobate of delightful ceramic produces blue vibration	3.2
The sensuous vibration of color clarifies white surface whose limit it marchks	3.0
We need this opposition between color and'noncolor' to make distinction between two, otherwise neither would hold such significance	2.9
Reaching Transcendence through Elimination of color: The Ideal Minimalism of Black and White	3.1
White helps to harmonize colors that would otherwise clash, it brings together and unites	3.1
White expresses certain incorporeality	2.6
Concrete bodies decemberrease space more or less depending on their color value	2.88
Against white, can actually establish intensity of clashing colors; white determines tone in first place	3.0
Medicine for one's mind	3.0
He began by telling us, Do not take any of what I say on faith	3.1
Do not take any of what I say on faith Take it through analysis, if there is some benefit in it for you	3.0
Take it through analysis, if there is some benefit in it for you	3.0
Religion, he said, is like drugstore full of medicine	2.9
You do not go to drugstore and buy everything in it you just buy what would be beneficial to you now	3.0
You believe other medicine may have just as much value, but in other situations, not this one	3.0
When we talked about giving, and how should try to give what could to other sentient beings in form of material items, kind words, protection, and so on , Khenpo Kalsang shared story of Buddha, and how Buddha had given his flesh so that family of hungry tigers could eat	2.92
The gentle wind makes them flutter	3.2
So,	3.0
So, fellow student asked, Giving one's life for another being is ultimate gift?	2.9
Giving one's life for another being is ultimate gift?	3.0

Only if you feel no regret,	3.0
Only if you feel no regret, he said	3.0
Orangegold light filters into grassy meadow, touching row of canvas tents and temple house beyond	3.2
Until then, preserve your own life, and do not give away anything that would cause you regret	2.9
This struck chord	2.7
Selfpreservation above all else, unless right situation arises	3.1
Knowing and understanding	3.0
Later, I talked to resident nun, Ani Kunga, about psychology and cognitive science	3.0
She had studied psychology for while in grad school, but now holds view that psychologists are going about understanding mind and understanding knower and what knowing is wrong way	3.0
Psychologists,	2.9
Psychologists, she said, study brain and self externally	3.0
But mind can only be known by you, person whose mind it is	3.0
She said philosophy and epistemology were doing it right: looking at experiences from inside	3.0
A big overlap exists between Tibetan Buddhism, psychology and cognitive science	3.0

During second philsophy session, Khenpo Kalsang translated sutra about king who received advice from Buddha	3.0
This sutra delved into some questions about nature of self, whether self is delusion, and how clinging of self is defilement	2.9

Compassion training and prayer flags	2.9
In afternoon, group of us gathered outside for meditation session with Ani Kunga	3.2
Sunshine melted lazily through tree branches above, breeze animating branches' shadows so they danced between our cushions	3.5
The key message:	3.0
If there is something you can do, why are you unhappy? Just do it If there is nothing you can do, why are you unhappy?	2.8
Just do it	3.1
If there is nothing you can do, why are you unhappy?	2.8
Ani Kunga explained several offsession and onsession technique for dealing with negative emotions anger, hate, irritation, stress, jealousy, and so on	3.1
Stay tuned for more indepth post on topic	3.0
Another of day's activities was making prayer flags	3.08
As Ani Kunga explained, Prayers, wishes, hopes, aspirations someone, many people, may share those with you	3.3
Prayers, wishes, hopes, aspirations someone, many people, may share those with you Hanging prayer flag shares your prayer with everyone else in world This may do no good at all, but it may if everyone hopes and wishes and dreams and aspires, perhaps it will do good It may not But if no shares their prayers, it will certainly do no good So on offchance that it will help, why not?	3.1
Hanging prayer flag shares your prayer with everyone else in world	3.2
This may do no good at all, but it may if everyone hopes and wishes and dreams and aspires, perhaps it will do good	3.4
It may not	3.0
But if no shares their prayers, it will certainly do no good	2.6
So on offchance that it will help, why not?	3.2
Never done	2.58
This weekend reminded me that I'm not done learning	3.2
I spent past weekend there	3.09
If I stay still long enough, if I've achieved relatively constant level of happiness and satisfaction, I forget that I can and should continue to seek out new ideas and approaches, and incorporate beneficial ones into my life	3.2
A person is never done, and so, I'll continue to observe and discuss and study, trying to pick directions in which I'll change, and trying to make tomorrow better than today	3.17
done,	2.9
Faded squares of fabric, strung together in repeating bluewhiteredgreenyellow chains, crisscross branches of barelimbed trees	2.9
Ever onward and ever upward	3.2
Everyone I've talked to who has previously attended says wonderful things about it; this semester, of my friends told me she was going: I should join her!	3.4
I like learning new things, so I signed up	3.6
A good decemberision: I did not return all chill and zen, as friend told me his roommate had, but I certainly gained few new ideas and approaches to mull over, and dipped my hand into previously unfamiliar piece of world	3.1
I'm not to make New Year's resolutions	3.0
They suggested that what you believe about selfcontrol affects goals you set and achieve PDF	3.0
In paper, selfcontrol is used to mean sense of willpower	3.0
selfcontrol	2.9
Mukhopadhyay Venkatarmani discuss various lay theories of selfcontrol, noting that amount of selfcontrol person has can be seen as either inherently limited or unlimited resource, and that this resource can be seen either as malleable or as fixed amount of selfcontrol person has can change over time, or not	3.0
I mean, sure, I could take my pick of popular New Year's resolutions; I could decemberide, on first day of new year, that this year, I'll start exercising more and eating better, or that I'll spend more time with my family and friends, or that I'll learn new skill	3.1
An important premise to note here is idea that probability of choosing goal or making resolution increases if person thinks that goal can be attained	3.1
So if you think you will be able to achieve goal, you are more likely to set it	3.3
Combine this with theories of selfcontrol, and in general, if you believe you have unlimited stores of selfcontrol, you will set larger number of goals	3.1
Mukhopadhyay Venkatarmani also discuss selfefficacy: belief in one's capabilities, perceived ability to carry out desired action	3.0
Selfcontrol, Selfefficacy, and New Year's Resolutions Unresolved	2.9
The studies	3.0
In first study, participants all college students each read of passages presenting lay theories of selfcontrol	3.0
Each passage contained paragraphs; first discussed selfcontrol either as limited or as unlimited, and second discussed selfcontrol as either malleable or fixed	3.1
The participants then answered questions about their belief in each of theories presented, followed by second questionnaire to assess motivation, in which they listed all their current goals	3.1
The experimenters had some concerns about participants' natural beliefs in relation to passages they read, however, so in study two, order of measures lay theories and motivationgoal listing was varied	2.9
Data from new participants revealed that, as hypothesized, if motivation goals questionnaire were assessed first, then among people who believed selfcontrol is malleable, those who also believed selfcontrol to be unlimited vs	3.0
limited set more goals	3.0
When lay theories were assessed first, this result reversed	3.0
The people who believed that selfcontrol is fixed were unaffected by order	3.0
The third study moved on to examine goal achievement, adding measure to look at selfefficacy	3.1
The study had sessions, in November then February	3.0
In first session, participants read passages about lay theories much like in study one, but with longer passages to strengthen manipulation , listed resolutions they were planning on making at New Years, rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions, and filled out individual difference measures which included selfefficacy scale	2.9
And if I chose to make resolutions, I'd be far from alone survey on Dorthy com found that of adults polled had made resolutions at some though only managed to keep them	2.9
Only participants successfully returned for second session, during which they indicated how much success they had had at keeping their resolutions	3.2
What does this mean for your resolutions?	3.0
The resolutions made by participants across all conditions were qualitatively similar take look at any list of popular New Year's resolutions, and you will see majority of goals	3.0
As shown in first studies, more goals were set by people who believe selfcontrol is unlimited and malleable than by any other people that is, if you expect more success, you may increase difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself	3.0
Selfefficacy did not have significant effect on goalsetting	2.9
As far as success goes, only interaction between lay theory and selfefficacy was significant	2.9
If participants believed in limited selfcontrol and were low in selfefficacy, they tended to give up more often, failing to achieve their goals	2.7
But in general, lay theories about selfcontrol can determine how much success you will expect and thus, how many goals you will set , and selfefficacy beliefs can determine how much success you will actually have	3.1

Chad was six, and at Roy should have been teasing or ordering Chad around or something	2.78
How are you feeling, Roy?	3.0
They all stood around while doctoberor made Roy shake and jerk and moan with sick sound	2.25
But thing in his head had not worked yet because of something having to do with, electric toads, which would not, sit up	2.7
Now, this year, Roy was in same grade as Chad, and it was embarrassing	2.5
Roy stepped around edge of building and out of sight	2.9
Just then Tucker Williams came climbing out of top of black fort like gold headed monster	3.0
Tucker was big, even for third grader, and he was not quite right in different way than Roy	2.8
Tucker was oldest boy in playground, and who decemberided rules of game	2.9
We're not ready yet	2.8
No time outs! Tucker shouted and continued to climb down tires	2.9
Several more boys spewed out after him	2.78
Roy!	3.5
Roy! Chad called, but his voice would only whisper	2.7
He did not want to be crybaby, Tucker hated crybabies	2.25
The rules of game were that Chad had to keep everyone away from his fort and away from his tumbleweed flag	3.0
From painful experience, he knew it was not going to be as easy as just pretending he was too slow or too weak to do anything	2.4
Going down too easy would only make him mad, so Chad reached behind him to grab stickers he had managed to collect before start of game and readied himself	3.0
The boys came in quick from all sides, knocking Chad down, but he managed to roll to his feet and get sticker off into boy's arm before being knocked down again	2.7
Chad strained and pounded rock into iron hole until he could smell dust	2.56
Baby!	3.6
Tucker was standing over him with huge tumbleweed held high in sun	3.0
You did not fight!	2.2
Chad tried to tell his arms to lift him and let him reach for tumbleweed to prove he was not baby to Tucker	2.88
Tucker leaned in low and his breath was sour as it blew in Chad's face	2.38
I'm gon na take plug out	3.0
Then Tucker's face became serious	2.62
Now Chad's legs and arms and mouth worked, and he was up and running and screaming, Roy, go inside! Roy!	2.67
Roy, go inside!	3.0
He sprinted for corner of building around which Roy had disappeared	2.56
The door was on that side and Mrs Rayburn	3.0
Just then horrible pain stung Chad's cheek and neck and ear	2.3
The tumbleweed's yellow thorned branches scratched around him as it dug into his face	2.36
He wished he were there now, even if he did have to sit next to Roy	2.9
Tucker made grab for him but missed it, and Chad heard his shirt rip little	2.7
He ran like only small boy can run, but he was losing and he wished hard that he could fly	3.0
Roy!	3.3
Chad rounded corner grabbing cinder block to help him turn faster just as Tucker came down again with tumbleweed from behind, and world slowed almost to stop	2.82
Roy stood with bill of his cap down	2.78
His head rose and his eyes focused over Chad's shoulder	3.0
Roy held stickers in his hand like flowers, but he bent looking down and snatched something from ground	3.2
His hand blurred and snapped out as he stood back up	2.6
Hey, Roy?	3.1
Something whined as it spun past Chad's ear, and he heard sharp, meaty thunk just behind him	2.9
The rock was too big to fit into iron hub of big cable spool, so Chad leaned it against tumbleweed and slid down off splintery wood on his belly to admire his handiwork	3.36
Tucker towered there with surprised expression and crossed eyes, tumbleweed in hand and screwdriver held up high in other ready to stab down into Chad's back	3.0
A sharp, flat, flint rock split Tucker's forehead and was buried deep and solid like part of Halloween costume complete with drop of blood just starting down toward his nose	2.2
Tucker dropped down like jacket from hook	2.75
It was Roy, and when Chad looked up there was something like his brother there around eyes	3.0
Yeah	3.1
Chad stepped back away from Tucker's openeyed face	2.82
I thought he might stab you Roy said and craned his neck forward to look at Tucker's face as other boys began to crowd around at respectful distance	2.3
Do you think he is dead?	2.6
Just then Tucker blinked and began to sob	1.84
Nah Chad said, We're gon na be in trouble	2.62
Nah	2.75
We're gon na be in trouble	2.3
Yeah	3.09
Hey, Roy?	3.11
What?	3.0
You suck	2.0
It was all right	3.3
The fort was lone, wooden cable spool like tall barrel with thick disks on its ends, each size of dinner table	3.0

I will not talk of first time Tasha and I tried any act of sex or sport together	2.8
I can remember similar things with others	3.0
Is that love?	3.0
But it is something marchvelous and rare, which is surely sign of love	4.0
If my love for her was only important thing, I would leave holo of her with note: Dear Future, this is Tasha Cortez	3.2
Dear Future, this is Tasha Cortez	3.25

This is not easy	2.29
I stand up, I walk around, I pretend someone makes vid about writer and I must enact every cliche	2.89
But I have learned something: writing trivializes	3.0
The Tasha who was is not Tasha in this file	3.0
The Tasha in this file is not even Tasha I loved and thought I knew	2.1
, she	3.0
Tasha is not whole of what happened on Vega IV	2.91
I must also write about Emiliano Gabriel Malaquez	3.0
Future Self, you know our style well enough to tell that time has passed between last sentence and this	3.1
Published in Double Feature by Emma Bull and Will Shetterly NESFA Press,	3.1
I have been rereading all our favorite books	3.33
But neither of us care to dwell on such boring subjects, do we?	3.14
I want to pick up with Tasha and me walking about The Sleeping Flamingo, and then, for sake of literary convenience, to say that from corner of yard I saw neighboring house, and sight filled me with darkest forebodings	2.5
But truth is that Tasha pointed it out from place where it could barely be seen, and I only felt envy that it had been designed by someone with understated good taste	2.7
Who lives there?	3.0
I asked	3.0
No one,	2.6
No one, Tasha replied	2.86
Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal treasured toy or last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually few hours after enclosing it	3.0
Truth is always more boring than fiction	2.8
For Malaquez did not move into Dream's End until or months after I we?	2.9
I do not plan to write book: this narrative must move more quickly	3.0
Tasha and I became lovers that evening, after good dinner of paella at her apartment	3.7
I made some small joke afterward, about approving of her firm's business incentives, and she cried	2.5
Consoling her, I began to suspect I loved her	3.29
I moved into The Flamingo next day; and she gave up her apartment weeks later to join me	3.1
It was sort of romance that happens so rarely that most people believe it does not happen at all, sort of romance that sustains hopeless billions who regularly watch A Wandering Star Called Love	3.4
Which is to say, you and me, Future Self	3.0
Who was Tasha Cortez?	3.0
She was Terran Standard N'Apulcan who left university training in hydroponics to work for her aunt's real estate firm	3.0
Her family said she did it to support her father, who was dying of particularly painful degenerative disease	2.37
Tasha said she woke up morning convinced that if she spent another day studying vegetables, she would become one	2.75
She did not like my plays	2.3
I had impressed her because I was famous and amusing and not, as I had hoped, because I was great artist	3.4
That bothered yes, and intrigued me until I realized that she was bored by most plays, movies, and vid	2.8
She did not like being spectator	2.6
I often told her that she should have biocheck to see if she suffered from some metabolic imbalance	3.0
I often told her too many things	2.7
Search Emiliano Malaquez and you will find he is master of captured moment school of sculpture	3.1
Even The Terran Times has only praise for his work	3.37
To compare his pieces to those of others is to compare mannequins to living models	3.0
He accents illusion of reality I paraphrase his entry in La Enciclopedia Humanica by doing lifesize scenes in full round, never easier frontal or view	2.86
Moreover, he never did portraits of famous people; his works were therefore reality and could never be compared to it	3.0
As is typical of his school, his pieces are sealed in stopboxes	2.9
The shimmer of light on their surfaces always reminds us that we are looking at instant snatched from under hooves of time	3.0
Yes, Self, I am also bothered that this observation ignores halfeaten cheese sandwiches, incomplete insect collections, and locks of infants' hair, forgotten in closets, basements, and warehouses	2.73
We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes	3.6
You see inspiration for my latest play, Captured Moments	3.1
The mindwipe will take its creation from my future self but time too often does that without aid	2.78
The play's second act concludes with last fight between Tasha and me	2.9
I have disguised us in play, and deleted brief melodramatic interchange	3.0
I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play	3.22
Now I will mention it, in case IYou decemberide to restore it	3.22
You'll impoverish yourself	2.9
I only snarled at her and	2.5
My story leaps ahead of itself	3.0
Let me retreat and retrench:	2.75
night during N'apulco's mild winter, Tasha returned to The Flamingo, saying, Nardo!	3.2
Nardo!	3.37
Nardo!	3.0
You wish to become pregnant?	3.1
Purely for sake of race, of course	3.0
Ever altruist	3.0
Later, I said, You've been chosen to succeed Emperor	3.12
What?	2.8
She batted at my nose like cat	3.0
Silly Nardo	3.0
Emil Malaquez is buying house up hill	3.3
night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo stopbox	3.22
Oh	3.0
You do not know who he is?	2.88
Well	3.0
Nardo!	3.0
I am never so quickwitted in person as I am on page	2.87
Especially when someone thinks me shockingly ignorant	2.4
You know, sculptor	3.0
He's had shows in Brazil and New Madrid and everywhere!	3.6
He may be more famous than you	2.9
Imagine that	3.0
I remembered article in The Medusa and photo of work in which peso notes fell like confetti onto small Undersider, sexlessly young in grimy, oversized clothing	2.88
Imprisoned light from forgotten streetlamps snagged itself on metal threads in fluttering pesos	3.0
A great artist will grace this world, then?	3.1
Nardo!	3.12
She was never tolerant of my ego	2.3
Well	3.1
What's this morefamousthanme person like?	2.9
I did not meet him, jealous old one	2.6
Too bad	2.0
If I thought he could free me from you	2.67
Hah!	3.2
She wrapped her arms around my stomach	3.8
You'll never be free of me, old man!	2.8
Wondering about reason for her extravagance, I asked how work had gone that day	3.0
Bringing my face close to shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me	2.82
Emil came in	3.0
Emil?	3.0
You've no memory left, old one	2.5
Emil Malaquez	3.0
Ah	3.0
What?	3.1
I did that in comedy once	3.0
'Nights with Karl and Groucho'	3.1
The critics liked it	3.8
A moment later: That's not why I called him'Emil'	2.9
That's not why I called him'Emil'	2.67
No	2.5
We lunched together	3.57
He's nice	4.0
Oh	2.88
It was not like that	2.6
Of course	3.1
Still, it was not like that	2.3
As you may have guessed, we had talked about such things	3.0
I do not claim ours was perfect affair, only wonderful one	3.62
Do you?	3.0
Good	3.6
I invited him to dinner tomorrow	3.37
Oh?	2.9
He'll be our neighbor	3.1
You say we are becoming too insular, that we need to socialize	2.5
Nardo?	3.0
Yes?	3.0
How should I reply?	2.9
Her voice had grown quiet, and I began to feel some guilt	2.22
I had, it is true, told her that we needed other company than our own	2.89
I said this from years of learning that romances consume themselves without other fuel	3.12
I said, Truthfully	3.1
It was statement of younger and crueler man than I	2.5
She screamed, I have not socialized with Terra's elite for most of my life!	2.4
The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased	2.8
And I invite neighbor, nice, lonely man	3.6
I'm sorry	2.11
who took me to What?	2.8
I'm sorry	2.0
Truly	3.1
Oh	3.0
I'm sorry, too	2.2
I suppose I sound like I'm bragging when I talk of things I'm tired of	3.0
Only because you are	3.0
She smiled	4.0
I had to grin, so I did	3.6
True	3.1
If you wish, he may be dinner	3.1
I love you	4.1
And I, you	3.0
Months earlier, we might have sought bed, couch, or comfortable chair at this point	3.1
Instead, I asked, Is he handsome?	3.0
Is he handsome?	3.3
You're jealous	2.22
A tiny bit	3.0
Extremely	3.5
Content yourself, old one	3.1
He's inches shorter than I, his nose is big and broken, and	2.5
But as soon as I coughed, I laugusthed, and I did not try to kill myself that night	2.9
This is cosmetic?	2.7
He's not that ugly	2.6
I think they are his natural features	3.1
Interesting	3.3
You could write play about someone like him	3.22
Perhaps	3.0
I think his face is his form of vanity	2.82
It's reverse of you with those ridiculous stomach muscles	2.88
Old men should be fat	2.8
Is Emil?	3.0
Yes	3.71
I am jealous	2.25
I'll eat dinners tonight	3.2
deserts	3.0
She giggled	3.9
And then we did make love	4.0
I've been thinking about mindwipe, now days away	2.9
Who said that those who forget past are doomed to repeat it?	3.0
This work is hereby released into Public Domain	3.0
I fear that may be true for me	2.6
Emil Malaquez arrived after sundown, carrying small package wrapped in what looked like real paper	3.0
His evening dress was formal, expensive, and slightly stained, as that of all forgetful artists should be	3.0
He was jovial man with easy laugusth, and even uglier than Tasha had suggested	3.11
I liked him immediately	3.9
Senior Malaquez?	3.11
Call me Emil	3.25
You must be Bernardo	3.0
All of it outrageous praise?	3.1
Ah, she is wonderfully perceptive	3.8
He raised eyebrow, then guffawed	3.43
Has she said as much about me?	2.71
Do come in	3.29
Thank you	3.88
Stepping into living room, he said, A beautiful house	3.8
A beautiful house	3.56
I'm glad you came after dark	3.7
Tasha, by accident or design, had found innocently erotic posture on couch, where she lay with book of M'duvian prints	3.22
Emil!	3.4
She leapt up	3.0
I did not expect you	2.45
on time	3.2
It's unforgiveable, but you are forgiven	2.8
What's that?	2.9
For your kindness in inviting stranger into your home	3.43
Oh!	3.33
Tasha snatched it from him to rip away paper	2.5
I went walking, but after N'apulco, Rio seems no fit abode for creature of flesh	2.82
I walked from this hotel to old city, past end of slidewalks and softwalks to hard, cracked pavement of City Park	3.0
But Undersiders left me alone	2.75
Perhaps they recognized fellow ghost	2.8
Last year, I rented small house on Vega IV, sea world, all islands and reefs and archipelagos, turquoise waters and aquamarchine skies, sunrises like symphonies and sunsets like stars gone supernovembera	3.6
Tasha oohed in awe	3.5
I said, Frodo's been visiting you, eh?	3.0
Frodo's been visiting you, eh?	3.1
Malaquez said, Your pet?	3.0
Your pet?	3.2
Hardly	2.7
He lives around here somewhere	2.9
Ah,	3.12
Ah, Malaquez said	3.0
Why'Frodo'?	2.75
Tasha said, A little fellow with big, furry feet	3.25
A little fellow with big, furry feet	3.1
She handed sculpture to me	3.0
I almost dropped it; I expected it to weigh no more than holo	2.8
Heavy,	2.7
Heavy, I said, as if he might not have known	2.9
He laugusthed	4.0
My last piece was of old Undersiders crouched around trash fire	3.0
Be glad someone did not toss that to you	3.29
He spoke of his art with enthusiasm of	3.8
Um, I should wait to importune you, but	3.0
A confession, and then request	2.9
It's not easy for me to ask favor	2.83
Relax,	3.6
Relax, I said	2.9
It's easy for me to turn down	3.2
The surprising thing is that I was	3.0
Good	4.2
My last show	2.7
was glorious!	4.0
Tasha said	3.0
was kindly received,	3.5
was kindly received, he said	3.3
Oh?	3.0
I hoped no would bring up my last plays	2.9
No more urchins, dopers, vagrants, or whores	2.8
He spoke quickly, prepared to be rejected	2.25
Would you permit me to do of you?	3.1
I would pay	3.1
Never,	2.5
Never, I said	2.25
Ah	3.0
He shrugged lightly	3.0
Nardo!	3.0
It's honor	4.0
Of course, I said	3.11
That's why I can not take payment	2.86
Oh?	3.0
Oh!	3.29
Thank you!	3.88
Malaquez turned to Tasha	3.0
And you as well?	3.12
Perhaps of you together?	3.0
Her eyes became circles at idea of being, as she undoubtedly thought it, immortalized by Emil Malaquez	3.4
Oh	3.0
My God, yes, yes, yes!	4.3
For perfect moment, Emil and Tasha and I were entity, laugusthing until our lungs hurt	4.38
This is torture	1.67
I had not considered that I might not write to learn, but to punish myself	2.14

Let me abuse playwright and dismiss penultimate scene in few sentences: After giving Emil full rights to sculpture of Tasha and me, we had good dinner of curried clam chowder, lobsters boiled on Terra and unstopped still steaming on N'Apulco, and cinnamon custard for desert	3.0
She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as expert	3.1
I once had neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better	2.5
So, I think, did she	3.0
The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by leap that I made	3.1
She had no choice but to follow	2.8
I do not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to	2.5
Those who are truly curious may look at last act of Captured Moments	3.1
Malaquez glanced away, embarrassed	2.4
I will	3.33
I feel sorry for you, Nardo	2.38
I'll see Emil home	3.0
Yes,	3.4
Yes, I said, Do that, and did not care what she did, or why	3.0
Do that,	3.12
Emil asked, You're all right?	2.8
You're all right?	2.91
I muttered something he must have interpreted as assent	3.0
They both walked up to Emil's home while I watched scarlet moonlight ripple on distant waves	3.0
Disgusted with Tasha but more disgusted with myself, I finally realized she would not return that night and went into The Sleeping Flamingo to drink myself to sleep	2.14
She had not come home when I woke in midmorning	2.1
I waited, and drank glass of MorningAfter and cups of coffee, and wondered whether our affair could survive events of night, and whether I wanted it to	2.5
Perhaps I should have invited Emil to stay, but even then I knew that sex was not problem between Tasha and me	2.7
The problem was that I have trouble distinguishing between compromise and capitulation, between symbols and substance	2.75
Shortly before noon, I climbed sandy path to Dream's End, rehearsing my apology, slowing only to pluck burrs from between my sandals and my feet	2.6
Malaquez answered door in bloodred pajamas and black silk robe	2.9
years ago in similar situation, I had broken my knuckles on someone's face	2.5
I merely said, Is Tasha here?	2.8
Is Tasha here?	2.9
Now N'apulcans profit from their Hispanic siblings	2.9
He pursed his lips slightly, then nodded	3.0
Yes	3.29
May I see her?	3.0
When he hesitated, I said, Last night was my fault	2.5
Last night was my fault	2.2
I hold it against neither of you	3.0
I	3.0
Please	3.1
He looked me and at last said, Very well	3.33
Very well	3.5
We walked through his house in silence	2.9
If that was Malaquez's work, it was very minor effort	2.8
But then, I was in no mood to consider art	2.63
That was easier than despising myself	2.88
I do not mean to sound cynical	2.57
I should go in first	3.0
What would it hurt?	2.8
True	3.33
Go ahead	3.14
Tell her	2.9
I shrugged	2.8
Tell her I love her	4.4
I suppose I wish to show that I'm still capable of certain authorial distance, semblance of dispassionate observation	2.88
He studied me, then said, I'm sorry things happened this way, Bernardo	2.7
I'm sorry things happened this way, Bernardo	2.12
I'm very good at making things happen this way	3.38
But if Tasha will forgive me	2.4
He nodded, repeated, I am sorry, then slipped into next room	2.25
I blinked when I opened door	3.0
Sunlight filled Malaquez's bedroom	3.37
Tasha lay sprawled nude on rumpled bed	2.9
She was looking slightly to my left, smiling with trust and satisfaction like sexually content	3.63
Malaquez stood near her, pointing something at my chest	3.0
The part of my mind that remembered months in NorAm during Great Cleaning sent me rolling across floor	2.56
Malaquez was not prepared for me to react so quickly, or perhaps he waited too long for expression I would not have, gesture I would not make, poignant moment of repentence, wonder, despair, or love	3.0
The following events may indicate otherwise	3.0
Had he been faster, he could have had rage	2.8
As he fell, I scrambled onto him, my knees pinning his arms, my fingers probing his neck	2.44
I shouted, Where is she?	2.82
Where is she?	3.0
Tell me, or I'll kill	2.4
He began to cry	1.9
She left	2.8
Earlier this morning	3.0
Her clothes lay by cube enclosing bed	2.9
I hit him with back of my hand	2.6
Tell me, Malaquez	3.09
She wanted to be famous	2.9
He seemed to expect me to understand	2.86
Where!	3.2
I demanded, squeezing his throat until he began jerking his head madly at sculpture	2.3
I stared at naked Tasha	3.25
In fine tourist tradition, most homes on Vega IV are named	3.0
He began with small animals and moved on to derelicts and Undersiders, people who would never be missed	3.0
Now he had thought to use vacationers like Tasha and me, and when someone came looking, he would say we had gone islandhopping in our windboat	3.0
Our boat would disappear into ocean to be found or not as wind and tides chose	2.6
Mine was The Sleeping Flamingo, and its outer walls were coral pink	3.0
His story would stand in either case	3.0
I wanted him to tell me more, but he babbled, begging me to forgive him, to understand	2.8
I did not listen	2.33
I think I was wondering what it meant to say that thing was art, so we accepted it as art	2.88
Or perhaps I was thinking about things that humanity made that would outlive our species	2.9
But I was probably only looking at my reflection in capturador's lens	3.0
Had he said then that I should use it on myself, I might have	2.86
That moment passed	2.56
I looked at Malaquez	3.1
Were they moodsensitive, they would have changed as I first viewed them	3.1
His lips contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound	2.8
I turned to touch cube that was Tasha's crypt	2.4
She smiled in trust or pleasure or pride, erotic Mona Lisa who would smile forever, and I could never know why	3.44
I could free Tasha	3.1
If I did, of things would happen	3.1
And tiniest chance of all: she would blink as if I had just materialized in Emil's bedroom, and then she would laugusth and tell me that she was going to be immortal	3.0
The rental agent, attractive N'apulcan named Tasha Cortez, was not moodsensitive either	2.8
As I put my hand on impervious surface of Tasha's stopbox, I heard Malaquez run for door	3.0
It is strange to know that we can do acts of unrepayable kindness to those we should hate	3.1
Know this, my future self: Thanks to us, Emil Malaquez's name will live as long as his masterpiece, A SelfPortrait: Anguish, endures	3.4
I could say that I did not dare to take responsibility for her fate	2.67
But I can not stop thinking that I was never afraid of losing Tasha to brain damage or death	2.2
My fear is that she would live, and I would learn that I had lost her long before Emil Malaquez translated her into thing that can be kept, admired, and loved	2.6
For in my way, I have done same thing	3.0
I am ready for mindwipe now	2.89
It's beautiful, is not it, Senior Flynn?	3.5
But she was young and attractive as I have said and may say again and eager and so happy to be assisting infamous Bernardo Flynn that I merely raised eyebrow in mild scepticism	2.8
And then, because playwright can not resist promising line, I said, Your Sleeping Flamingo should be put to sleep	2.78
Your Sleeping Flamingo should be put to sleep	2.44
To say her face fell would do disservice to Tasha and to literature	2.9
Allow me my selfindulgences as you would those of dying man when I convince my mindsmith to permit wipe, there will be another Bernardo Flynn, who knows no more of Tasha Cortez or Vega IV than he reads here	2.88
Her lower lip trifle too narrow for her face, perhaps her only physical flaw thrust forward slightly as she started to speak	3.29
She caugustht herself, slid her jaw infinitesimally back into place, and said, You do not like it?	2.7
You do not like it?	2.7
What could I do?	2.62
Like it?	3.33
I hate it, despise it, abhor it!	1.3
It's gaudy, graceless, pretentious That house is affront to taste and intelligence	2.5
I should buy it to raze it, but I am not so kindhearted	2.5
I might, however, rent it	3.0
Captured Moments	3.4
I think she only heard last words of my speech	2.7
Show me around, and then I shall decemberide	3.0
Of course, Senior Flynn	3.12
And stop calling me'senior'	2.43
Not even Los Mundos is so polite	2.9
If you wish	3.18
I beg you, change color of walls, at very least	2.67
I stared	3.0
How's that?	3.0
I looked at her	3.0
Worse?	2.6
I nodded	3.0
I would not have thought it possible	3.11
She frowned	2.43
It is rather ugly	2.2
Thoroughly ugly,	2.29
Thoroughly ugly, I corrected with smile	3.0
Obscenely ugly,	1.4
Obscenely ugly, said she, smiling too	3.87
No	2.9
I pointed	3.0
It has no tower	2.82
She reached for another dial on house controls	3.0
Do n't you dare!	2.5
Her wrist, when I grabbed it, was smooth and strong and warm in my fingers	3.4
I'll take it	3.75
Exactly as it is	3.0
God knows what you might do to it next	2.8
Reluctantly, I released her hand	2.4
The interior of The Flamingo was welcome surprise	3.5
Cloudwood had been used in Mediterranean manner, making house seem primitive and civilized at same time	3.14
The kitchen and baths had every convenience that I desired	3.5
From living room, view of beach struck me with such intensity that Tasha asked if I felt ill	3.0
I'm in love	4.37
We both thought I referred to vista	3.1
It's strange how can write delightedly of happier moments of life, forgetting things that would forget by remembering fully things would remember, and suddenly forgotten, in revenge, rears up to savage unwary	2.6
My heart convulsed, and I left this manuscript for spree	3.0
And if I can brag and digress so easily, this must not be painful enough to merit mindwipe, yes?	2.7
I abandoned these notes to my future self to have wipe done immediately, thinking that Bernardo Flynn should receive such services when he needed them, even should need arise at third hour after midnight	2.78
Captured Moments	3.2
My mindsmith is not so understanding	2.5
She says I am emotionally child, to which I reply, Of course	3.0
Of course	3.2
Why else would I come to you?	2.75
This logic does not soothe her; she says I must wait weeks	2.6
Such is law	3.0
I say I do not care about law, I care about service and she should care about money	2.8
Enough	2.3
I went on spree, and it must have been good one	3.67
I dimly remember bedpartners who were probably human, and that I hope was delirium	2.73
I will not answer phone for week, no matter whose face appears on it	2.63
I keep evading issue	2.6
But which issue?	2.9
To deal with first: it hurts to remember	2.0
If I am capable of love, I loved Tasha Cortez	3.56
If I am not, I had perfect mirror for my narcissism	2.9
As for issue itself, I'm no longer sure what I want to record	2.9
The playwright in me wants every scene of our time together	3.5

Wolves can run fast, but they certainly can not outrun airplanes	3.2
Given urgency of situation in Alaska, Defenders needs your immediate assistance to help save Alaska's wolves from sameday airborne landandshoot slaugusthter	2.7
Support Emergency Effort to Save Alaska's Wolves	3.0
Soon this wolf will not be merely running in snow	3.0
Defenders hopes to raise at least , to help Alaskans For Wildlife, coalition of Alaska citizens, win citizens' ballot initiative this November	3.0
And we face very wealthy opponents	2.6
This wolf will be running for its life!	3.0
Like you, majority of Alaskans oppose sameday landandshoot wolf killing	3.0
But antiwolf politicians in Alaska legislature do not care what majority of Alaska citizens want	2.29
And they did not listen to recommendations of Alaska Department of Fish and Game, which opposed this legislation!	2.6
They are utterly out of step with their Alaska constituents state agency that manages Alaska wildlife and rest of American public!	2.3
The airplane above will be tracking her in order to land and immediately gun her down	2.89
In name of wolf control, wolf killers will predictably once again use aircraft to hunt wolves to of exhaustion, so that wolves have, literally, no chance of survival	2.14
wolf control,	2.9
Before ban on sameday landandshoot, as many as wolves were killed in Alaska each year because of this barbaric and unethical practice	2.4
Antiwolf interests are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure that new landandshoot law stands, even though most Alaskans do not support it	2.9
Last Frontier	3.18
Say NO to barbaric practice of sameday airborne wolf killing	2.3
NO	1.7
The only way Alaskans can repeal new law and reinstate ban on sameday airborne landandshoot wolf killing is with Citizens' Referendum	3.0
You see, Alaska legislature passed law that once again allows any private citizen with just trapping or hunting license to track wolves by aircraft and then land and gun them down	2.6
Alaska wolf advocates need your immediate support to save wolves	3.0
As I mentioned, this new sameday airborne landandshoot practice will start in September after opening of hunting season and first snow, and when wolves will be easy target	2.8
To repeal this unconscionable law, Defenders must help provide our friends in Alaska Alaskans For Wildlife, with resources necessary to win at polls in November	2.78
We need help to supplement funds raised by Alaskans For Wildlife for careful polling, development of voter education spots for television, radio and newspapers, placement of those ads, and getoutthevote efforts on election day	3.0
A loss will encourage those antiwolf fanatics who want to stop wolf restoration and put bounties on those wolves already in wild	2.6
Please sign your Citizens' Advisory Ballot to demonstrate to our Alaska allies that you are behind them; and send urgent donation today to help them win this effort	3.0
So how will your money be spent?	3.0
Here's projected budget breakdown: , , indepth, statewide survey conducted by top pollster to determine voters' positions on ballot measure and arguments that will help persuade undecemberided voters	3.11
, , salaries office expenses for staff to oversee effort between now and election day	3.0
, , production of television and radio spots alerting public to findings of above survey	3.0
This cruel, unethical wolfhunting practice is called sameday airborne landandshoot	2.22
, , placement of voter education spots in key media including print, radio and television	3.0
Dear Defender,	3.0
, , election day getoutthevote drive, including phone calls to get voters to polls	3.0
getoutthevote	2.9
You stood by Defenders when we defeated wealthy American Farm Bureau in court and saved lives of wolves in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho	3.14
sameday airborne landandshoot	3.0
Now, I'm hoping I can count on your moral and financial support again today	3.17
to help save Alaska's wolves from sameday airborne landandshoot killing	2.5
Your special donation today is absolutely critical, because many of Alaska's politicians clearly have antiwolf agendas	2.9
They have financial backing of powerful special interests and determination to ignore will of people of Alaska and American public	2.9
Please let Alaskans know that you are behind them	3.0
It was total shock and surprise	3.22
Let them know you share their concern about protecting Alaska's wolves	3.2
Please help save Alaska's wolves by doing these things:	3.1
RUSH special donation to help our Alaska allies overturn this odious new law	3.2
Remember, for this emergency effort to succeed, we must act immediately	3.0
So, please take out your pen right now and sign your absentee ballot	3.1
Thank you for your strong support	3.5
P S: Defenders needs your help to raise , in emergency funds to help ensure that coalition's Emergency Effort to Save Alaska's Wolves succeeds	3.0
Time is so short	2.9
Look closely at this photo, and you will see wolf running	3.0
But they did, overriding Governor Tony Knowles' veto, and ignoring will of majority of Alaska's citizens	2.6
Unfortunately, this practice will begin after first snow this September when wolves will be can'tmiss targets against Alaska's snowy terrain	2.71
They lack means to build her back to her former glory, but she will not be abandoned	2.6
For all of those who are trapped there by their circumstances, there are just as many who insist that they would not live anywhere else	3.0
Thank you for opportunity to see postBushCo era Detroit through prism of your vision	3.6

Detroit will not be death of courage of those early Detroit pioneers; it looks like Nature will prevail after all	3.1

I, too checked out few listings for under , and was absolutely shocked at property taxes	2.7
A , house, which could be fixed up into maybe , house comes with tax bill of K per year!	2.8
The taxes on my K house in urban area of Mississippi are only year	3.5
And so Quiet Earp and I did some research, and came up with list of houses selling for under grand	3.2
We had plenty to choose from: there were more cheap houses than we would have time to visit	3.7
We picked neighborhoods to cruise, and dove in	3.3
But once we entered Detroit, truth hit fast: this is modern American ghost town	2.7
The place is practically deserted	2.6
Its streets, built wide to accommodate heavy traffic, are mostly empty	2.9
Houses and businesses are boarded up, painted up, bombed out and falling down	2.3
I videotaped it:	3.0
It got worse as we drove into residential areas, looking for those cheap houses	2.0
Even in Chicago's South Side, where we counted white people in hour, I felt fine just driving around; not so in Detroit	2.6
Truthfully, it was not about race: it was about being naive	2.9
It was about driving down streets where we truly did not belong and were not welcome	2.4
The longtime center of American automotive manufacturing was gutted when Big car companies simultaneously failed	2.7
They live in deserted neighborhoods, in houses with collapsed front steps and missing windows	2.8
They sit on porch and watch cars go by, watch deals go down, watch their neighborhoods crumble	2.3
And we, driving through slowly and reading house numbers in latemodel Honda, stuck out like couple of thumbs	2.6
So we sped up, and went straight to houses	2.91
Sometimes we stopped to take photo, but mostly we did not	2.9
Earp and I have each lived happily in wilds of West Oakland, but danger I felt in Detroit was like nothing I'd experienced before	2.4
I was actually afraid for my life	1.7
The New York Times correspondent wrote that his friend Mitch's , home had already been stripped of its appliances and wiring	2.8
But for Mitch that only added to its appeal, because he now had opportunity to renovemberate it with solar heating, solar electricity and lowcost, highefficiency appliances	3.6
As for house?	3.0
It needed some work, hole patched, some windows replaced	2.7
needed some work, hole patched, some windows replaced	3.0
Well, I do not know what part of Detroit these folks live in, but houses I saw looked more like this:	2.9
Detroit and Myth of House Uprooted, ecotravel blog	2.9
Detroit, already plagued by corruption and crime, saw its unemployment rate skyrocket in	2.2
You see, abandoned houses in this town get set on fire	2.8
No exceptions	2.64
Wherever we went in those neighborhoods, in houses had been torched	2.4
We did not slow down to take photo, but I'll paraphrase: DO N'T BURN HOUSES DOWN!	2.1
DETROIT POLICE ARE WATCHING YOU!	2.5
Except that they obviously are not	2.7
People who live in this part of town are on their own	2.27
And although I and many others would love to own even firescarred, condemned building, fact is that we would not last week here	2.7
There will be green movement here; in fact it is already being cultivated by forwardthinking groups and intrepid locals	3.3
What's left behind when economy collapses?	2.6
day, this place will be reborn	3.3
But right now, NYT's story reeks of Shinola	2.6
Anyone who takes this plunge is risking their life every day, betting on future that may take long time to arrive	2.8
Long story short: Yes, you can buy house in Detroit for	3.3
Cheap real estate, that is what	2.8
And you will get what you pay for	2.9

I'd read New York Times article about some forwardthinking artisttypes who bought house in Detroit for ,	3.0
Great post	3.7
Thank you for this info	3.5

Myself Sep, at : am	3.0
Please track down and watch movie called Detroit: A City to Yourself , by Nicole MacDonald	3.1
Detroit: A City to Yourself	2.9
It's full of this imagery, and talks about fire and rebuilding, and postindustrial devastation that is ravaged city since	2.9
Most poignantly, it talks about Hurricane Katrina, which focused attention on rebuilding another city with this level of devastation, and how without single catastrophic event to blame for it, Detroit's decemberay has gone unsympathetically ignored	2.6
About pop fiction which explores concept of posthuman world, and how it already exists now	3.1
And about how, if you are pheasant, that is not such bad thing	3.1
HOWEVER	2.8
There's lot more to Detroit than that	3.0
There are industrial spaces being turned into lowrent artist lofts and business incubators	3.1
Look at Russell Industrial Complex, for example	3.0
There's whole bunch of nice stuff happening along riverfront, from downtown up towards Stroh Place	3.6
Some of us and lots of New Yorkers pay that much in rent every month!	2.7
And there is always Belle Isle	3.2
When friends come to Detroit, I take them there	3.18
It's our intheriver park, acres of green space, with zoo, botanical garden and conservatory, rentable paddle boats, and tons of other neat stuff	3.3
Oh, and entry is free, so it is available to anyone regardless of economic status	3.4
You're liable to see families picnicking, bums gathering bottles and cans, geese foraging, and deer cautiously wandering edge of woods	3.2
Within yards of each other	3.0
Some of that cheap real estate is not too horrible, either	3.2
There's whole street being taken over by artists, Farnsworth between Moran and McDougall	3.2
Some of things they have done down there are amazing, and community garden is great bridge to surrounding neighborhood	3.8
America's Rust Belt is swath of cities and towns that boomed during Industrial Era and now lie well, rusting as empty remainders of glory days past	2.7
A few weeks ago, someone broke into their shed to steal their garden tools	2.0
Whoever took that stuff is probably using it in their own garden	2.9
Yes, Detroit's got more than its share of bad spots, you are right	2.8
I've lived in metro area my whole life, and there are areas I can not call them neighborhoods down there where I do not feel safe in daytime, much less at night	2.4
But there are bright spots, and behind every of them is person, or bunch of people, who refuse to give up	3.4

You are exactly kind of person who gives me back hope I lost on my way into town	3.8

Really?	2.9
solidarity	3.2

Most of funny looks you got were less about your color than about your ride	3.09
You think I'm kidding, but I could not be more serious that Honda is visceral reminder for people of how American consumer has left Detroit in dust	2.3
Even if it was real fixerupper, even if you really were better off tearing it down than living in it, that would still be hell of deal	3.4
Detroit proper has been dying for long time before riots, even	2.6
Its going to take some pioneering individuals to start creating those pockets of innovemberation, creativity, and vision	3.0
But its not going to happen with investment of into single house	2.5

Safe?	3.1
I looked around	3.0
thing this place did not seem was safe	2.2
He started walking down steps and around corner	3.0
It would have taken plenty to surprise me after what I had already seen, but My jaw was banging against my shoelaces when I rounded that corner	2.67
I'm not sure how something so big could have been hidden by that little turn in landscape, but maybe perspective does not work quite same there	3.0
Glaring down at me from no more than feet away was grimacing, foot tall black face with staring, blue and white eyes and it wore ridiculous little hat	2.5
He took sip and closed his eyes like cheap cup of coffee was really something special	3.3
For some reason I thought of giant clown face from carnival ride, but it scared hell out me	2.1
Acres stood beside it and somehow using him as yardstick for scale of thing made it easier to see	3.0
It was moai	3.0
This is what I wanted to show you	3.2
I looked down and saw he was pointing to another marchker just slightly different from we had just left	3.1
I was pretty rattled, but things fell together for me looking at big statue, Hawaiian shirt and marchk on ground	2.75
Acres nodded	3.2
It was all too much for me so I focused on part I could handle	2.88
So what does this have to do with gold?	2.9
You could step on that marchker and make gestures,'device,' and it would be like pushing button in very complex machine	2.78
You would end up on small hill on Rapa Nui	3.0
You could step feet to right and do same thing, and you would end up buried alive in nearby rock face	2.7
But I know how to make it take me anywhere	3.3
It read, Department of Treasury, Financial Management Service, Status Report of U S TreasuryOwned Gold	3.11
I sucked in whole lot of air	2.75
Anywhere?	3.17
Anywhere, he walked around moai and came back wrestling with big, heavy bar of gold	3.2
They only check deep storage once year	3.0
Otherwise vault is sealed	3.1
He set cup down and looked straight at me for first time	3.1
Does anyone else know about this?	3.1
No, they would have been on Rapa Nui if they knew, ready to stop me	2.91
This is ounces which I mentioned at restaurant	3.0
About , dollars at this morning's rate	2.91
I looked at sheet in my hand	3.0
I had to read it twice	3.0
I had never seen dollar sign in front of that many number before	3.0
The gold is still there	3.36
How much can we sell before someone becomes suspicious?	2.71
Charles put bar down and slid web pouch over it with shoulder straps like small backpack	2.8
Call me small minded, but you know bird in hand	3.0
But I could handle and easy, say from fence	3.1
Fine	2.8
I waived down waitress and ordered cup of decemberaf and slice of pie	3.0
Then I made my way back to little marchker where we came in	3.0
His mistake had been in telling me same gesture opened door other way	2.89
So icy wind at top of mound and bright moon came as real relief	3.37
The highway patrol was just bound to come by then	3.1
After that it was just connect dots back to prison	2.44
The rental car records pointed to Acres, and there was enough blood on knife to match DNA from Acres comb in motel	2.8
They never bothered trying to explain how Acres made it into country without ticket on plane or boat	2.78
I did not like his tone much	2.2
But they speculated all through trial about where gold came from, offered me deals	3.1
The prosecution liked idea that Acres was my smuggler's mule	2.9
I was man gold cartel in news	3.1
So you sure you are not cop, Charles?	3.0
I'm just wondering what they will think when they open that vault in Kentucky	3.1
Acres said it was dangerous, but maybe I could find my way back to mound or Easter Island even	2.8
I figure it can not be worse than lethal injection that is waiting for me at dawn	2.0
I stared him down until he flinched	2.7
I do not really believe I'll make it or I would not say thing	2.37
Wish me luck	3.25
I out of here	2.8
As I did, I noticed just how tired he looked around eyes	2.78
'm not cop	2.9
Charles might be for real, but he was still going to get me in deep trouble	2.57
Let's make real clear right now that you were joking, buddy	2.7
Otherwise this conversation is over	2.2
I've got parole officer to explain things to, and he would not like that kinda talk	2.6
Right	3.1
Sorry	2.27
Charles looked out window at passing traffic push through dirty slush for awhile	2.7
Like I was saying	2.9
I'm researcher, I've come into some valuable material that I would like to find buyer for, and I do not want to have to explain myself to anyone	2.88
He said he had business proposition for me	3.3
The pie came and I waited until waitress was gone, before going on, Why me?	2.45
You were first person who came to mind	3.1
First person?	3.0
years out of high school?	2.9
How much of this'valuable material' are we talking about?	3.0
ounces for start	3.14
Hundred	3.0
I pulled out my palm phone and looked up number	2.9
I'm staying in town	3.1
Let me show you something	3.0
I thought about it and made quick call, just telling buddy that I was postponing our meeting, for couple of hours, meaning he should come looking for me if I did not show up	2.8
He sounded surprised and said no, he needed me to help him get rid of large quantity of gold	3.25
Charles might not look like much, but I had not made it through my life taking that kind of chance	3.0
I put away cell and used motion to cover checking knife in my sleeve and used leg to check other in my sock	3.1
I had been amateur magician for years	3.2
of my best tricks was pulling knife out of thin air	3.4
It never failed to amaze	4.0
Sure	2.9
Let's go, I said	3.0
There was only chair, so I sat on edge of bed as he handed me book open to picture of some sort of stone tablet	2.9
Rapa Nui, he said, Easter Island	3.0
This codex is of few remaining examples of form of writing known as'rongorongo	3.1
I told him I'd meet him for coffee at diner down street at seven	3.14
For long time no was able to decemberipher it, although by deduction, Steven Fischer decemberiphered some of it in four	3.11
But he ignored inscriptions on skulls and'Birdman' statuette	2.8
And how missionaries came and converted natives had destroyed more	2.5
He flipped pages to another image, But notice something here in arrangement of moai	3.1
See here how they form pattern, very similar to this?	2.9
There was ink drawing and writing in tiny neat hand that I could not read from where I sat	2.9
he was already there, sitting in booth, warming his hands on cup of coffee	3.0
This is diary of mysterious explorer named Samuel Curlew who investigated Mound Builder site in this area in early hundreds	3.1
He closed little book and just about hugged it with satisfaction	3.89
I want to show you that mound	3.1
You know it was these very mounds that originally sparked my interest in history, archeology and then linguistics	3.33
And this mound is where you found gold?	3.1
Was this some crazy treasure hunt?	2.5
Or maybe this guy was just wacko who wanted to take me out on dark road and kill me	2.0
No, it is more complicated than that, but I need to show you mound for you to understand	2.63
He looked like jerked meat on bone	2.8
The drawings and books seemed to wake him up	3.1
He was smiling now and his eyes were not so tired	3.6
Charles Acres called me on Thursday afternoon, just like that	3.2
I was having serious cash flow issues back then and had payments to make, so I said, yes, but my patience was running out	2.4
It was dark as we left	3.0
When he killed headlights there was no light but moonlight and stars on light dusting of snow	2.8
A low, black hill blocked sky right in front of us	2.8
We spent next hour stomping around hill while he said things like, it was right here	2.8
My patience was long gone, and I was back in car to warming up when Acres tapped on window and told me he had found whatever he was looking for	2.7
We trudged back up hill and he led me to little patch of ground with stick poking up from it	2.86
It looked like bamboo walking stick	3.0
This is it, he leaned down and motioned for me to look at something on ground	3.0
See how lines form pattern in journal, same as moai	3.0
So you drew this? I asked vaguely, slow to catch on	2.67
So you drew this?	3.0
He looked hurt and rapped on ground with his finger	2.14
It's stone	3.1
Ancient	3.1
For first time he looked cold and stiff in his tourist gear, making me glad I was in suit	3.2
Here stand beside me, he said	3.1
I'm not sure if I can take you with me so I need to show you device	3.0
I expected him to pull out gadget with blinking lights and was wondering which way to duck	2.8
OK, watch and remember this	3.14
I'm going to do it in parts, last part first so it will not take effect	3.0
Stunned I watched as he made several ridiculous passes with his hands paused and nodded then did sort of sign language stutter of some sort	2.6
I learned this from skull shard rongorongo, they are not all writing language	3.0
Some are just memory device	3.1
Mnemonic	3.0
Yes	3.2
There's long history of Polynesian gesture and dance language	3.3
He smiled and I could see his teeth in moonlight	3.6
His hands were thin and huge knuckled with obvious callouses	2.9
I did not have much trouble duplicating his hand waving even though I had not paid much attention	3.11
I even swapped parts as he had asked	2.9
I thought he was surprised at my dexterity when his jaw dropped, but he shouted, No! just before everything changed	2.5
I was standing on perfectly flat square of dark stone	3.1
For as far as I could see by weak, gray light stone stepped up and down making little hills and terraces and platforms	3.11
I seemed to be somewhere in middle there was as much above as below	3.1
So, mining business is treating you pretty good, huh Charles?	3.25
The sky was dull and featureless and overcast	2.3
The air smelled bad in some way I can not describe, and at my feet I could see same design from little journal and mound carved into rock	2.38
I was in shock	2.2
and how can state legislature single out counties first Napa, now Sonoma for this treatment?	2.62
are they going to go through wineproducing counties by one?	3.0

I had thought of kiltman with respect to new AVA in Yorkville highlands, thinking Scot might have interest in playing bagpipes in uplands	3.0
Then, at Steve's site there is interesting discussion of his current ongoing efforts with blends from Carneros and Sonoma Coast	3.0
It's easy to get lost in nomenclatures, when is striving for new concepts	3.0
The problem, of course, is that by placing words Sonoma County on bottle of wine that is made with grapes grown in Russian River Valley , Dry Creek Valley , Sonoma Valley or any other AVA in Sonoma	2.8
Winkler heat summation datapoints also clarified several decemberades ago some of plant physiologic underpinnings of why Napa county and Sonoma county were natural leaders in premium winegrape production	3.0
There are many reasons why new labeling requirement makes sense from all these perspectives	3.18
JohnLopresti said	3.0
sorry, I keep forgetting Fermentation site's html protocol; here is OIVV label guideline link again:	2.8
OK, so here's real requirement: Any wine labeled with American Viticultural Area established yada yada, that is located entirely within yada yada, shall bear designation Sonoma County on label in type size not smaller than millimeters on containers of more than milliliters or smaller than millimeter on containers of milliliters or less	3.0
If I recall correctly, this is almost exactly same as requirement for government warning type size	2.9
So answer seems pretty clear to me: just add Sonoma County to government warning	2.66
Johnonwine said	3.0
It has to do entirely with promotional effort that has gone into making Napa Valley place associated with great wines	3.2
Such association will not be made with Sonoma County wines ever	2.75
Tom, I would suggest that all Napa wineries, good and bad, benefit from having Napa Valley on label; it is indeed great example of marchketing what you describe as promotional effort	3.1
County, consumers learn absolutely nothing about wine in bottle	2.6
That, fact that their wines cost less on average, and wineries are friendlier, less snooty is compelling story to get out to public	3.2
Heck, if folks knew all that, maybe folks would be seeking out bottles with Sonoma County on label	2.9
You suggest that this is bad law, that Sonoma County will never be associated with high quality wine in way Napa County is	2.5
There no evidence that grapes grown in Sonoma County have any single distinguishing feature derived from fact that they were grown inside borders of Sonoma County Assemblywoman Evans concludes, By improving consumer education on each bottle, conjunective labeling will unleash full potential of our delicious wines to represent Sonoma around world	2.9
I have confidence they will change, retool, improve, live up to their responsibilities	3.7
I worked selling and marchketing Sonoma County wines, I won awards for my marchketing efforts	3.5
The story is simple	3.11
People are receptive to it	3.25
Selling magic of Sonoma County wines is easy	3.83
That's my take anyway, I do not aim to be contrarian, but I do not mind being sole supporter of law as Sonoma County born and bred wine guy	2.8
She's correct	3.2
Beginning in , Sonoma County will receive tremendous boost in recognition due to conjunective labeling law that forces vintners to add more wording to their labels, whether they think words Sonoma County help or hurt their marchketing efforts	2.9
Frankly, if I was making high end wine from Sonoma Valley , Sonoma Mountain or Sonoma Coast AVAs that depended in part on quality recognition that comes wtih these AVAs, I'd be pissed that I'm forced now to put placename on my label that told my buyers nothing of real value about wine behind my label and, in some cases, demonstrably lowered its perceived quality	2.4
This moment marchks beginning of stronger Sonoma County brand for generations to come	3.3
Proponents of new Sonoma County Conjunective labeling law like to to similar law that demands Napa Valley be placed on all wines that are made from grapes grown in that appellation, rather than simply using sub appellation	3.0
But this prestige has nothing to due with law that demands Napa Valley , in addition to simply Rutherford , be placed on these wines	2.82
It has to do entirely with promotional effort that has gone into making Napa Valley place associated with great wines	3.1
Pushed as effort to promote Sonoma County wines and consumer education effort, new law instead forces vintners to needlessly sully their package and undermines their own marchketing efforts	2.8
Why is it important for someone making Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir or Sonoma Valley Zinfandel to help promote Sonoma County , designation that has no ability to define quality or character of wines in my Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir or my Sonoma Valley Zinfandel?	2.88
This is example of County usurping private label real estate, and it is very valuable real estate, for sake of promoting something that is of little use to private commercial interests	3.0
Ask yourself If putting words Sonoma County on one's wines was such great thing, why do not more vintners who make Dry Creek Valley , Russian River Valley , Alexander Valley or Sonoma Valley wines already put these words on their label?	3.1
Eminent Domain Used To Usurp Wine Label Real Estate	2.6
They legally could if they wanted to	3.0
The new Sonoma County conjunective labeling law is equivalent of State of California and County of Sonoma claiming imminent domain over labels of hundreds of vintners	2.5

We are going to have to totally redesign our front label to make room for Sonoma County and so far every mockup is cluttered and decemberreases impact of our brand	2.6
Our best option looks like we will go to North Coast or California for our front label appellation, and discuss grape source, vineyard name and meaningful AVA on back label	3.1

When I was kid in county called Solano not too famous for wines or AVAs people sometimes would happen by our place asking where rte was, where was Black Pt; people always were confused how somewhat neighboring counties had such similar names	2.9
According to Noreen Evans, Assembly sponsor of bill, this new conjunective labeling law requires that any wine labeled with American Viticultural Area AVA located entirely within Sonoma County like Russian River Valley or Dry Creek Valley must also include word Sonoma County on label, starting in	2.9
Now after several decemberades in Sonoma county I have learned to appreciate its uniqueness, for its viticulture and other industries	3.14
The town of Sonoma is on typical route people follow driving from Solano County to Sonoma County	2.8
The ambience in town Sonoma is only enclave; it is rightfully proud of its heritage as village, and for its viticultural traditions	3.4
But Sonoma county encompasses much more territory, and other AVAs within county are starkly different from characteristics of Sonoma valley and town of Sonoma	3.0
Vive la nouveau Sonoma County	3.2
Nick Perdiew said in to JohnLopresti	3.1
What do you make of fact that vintners already are free to put Sonoma County on any label they want?	2.7
If it were effective, would not you already see it virtually everywhere?	3.0
I admit, I do not see reasoning of your argument here	2.88
The issue of costs to vintners is nontrivial too as you can see above	3.0

Today's system balances competition with public safety to ensure that consumers can enjoy alcohol without suffering negative effects of unregulated marchketplace	3.1
Is there really any competition when statebased regulatory system wholesalers love so much require that producers of alcohol use wholesaler to bring their goods to marchket, meaning that without use of wholesaler producer can not enter state's marchket?	2.75
It also means that wholesalers get to decemberide what consumers drink, not consumers	2.5
Unfortunately effective statebased regulatory system in U S is under attack	2.25
Over past years, more than states have faced challenges in federal courts to their authority to regulate alcohol and their ability to maintain licensed system of alcohol controls	2.8
The only challenges to statebased alcohol regulatory system are those that discriminate against interstate commerce for protectionist reasons	2.78
Even in wake of successful suits that challenged protectionist laws that wholesalers originally pushed, state retained extraordinarily broad authority to maintain robust system of alcohol controls	2.9

H R : The Lies, The Facts, The Fictions	2.9
This bill, currently in Congress, would give wholesaler lobbyists means to turn back clock on consumer access to wine, lead to passage of laws that override federal regulations on alcohol, kill jobs and business that focus on artisan production of wine, beer and spirits, punish and dismantle small specialty wine retailers that serve consumers that wholesalers will not and override critical Constitutional principle of single American economic union	2.6
When economic interests of producers, retailers and consumers are horsewhipped by states doing bidding of wholesales who receive more government protection and welfare from state than any other industry in america, you might expect them to fight back	2.5
As for those that have concern , let us recall that it is only tiny fraction of state alcohol regulators, that there is no formal support from state attorneys general, only mere handful of public health advocates, selection of recipients of campaign contributions from wholesalers and wholesalers themselves that support H R	3.0

H R gives states ability to pass laws unchallengeable in court that would discriminate against outofstate wine shippers	3.0
And we know such laws would be introduced into various states since wholesalers have seen to it that such laws have been introduced into state legislatures for past years	2.88
With so much at stake for America's alcohol wholesalers and their protected monopoly status that props up unearned profits, it is no surprise they would swing for fences with all their stategranted political power and attempt to pass H R	3.0
In fact, H R would allow states to pass laws that make consumers receipt of wine by instate shippers legal while making receipt of wine by outofstate shippers punishable to greater degree than rape, home invasion or selling cocaine to children	3.0
Fact: Protection of state's power to regulate alcohol is not industry food fight	3.0
food fight	3.45
Better to call introduction of H R what it is: attack on entire alcohol industry and consumers for sake of protecting wholesaler profits	2.75
It's no coincidence that brewers large and small, wineries, spirit producers and importers, retailers, wine education organizations, wine consumers and free trade organizations all oppose H R	2.9

Thus originated Las Vegas's reputation as adult theme park	3.2
The areas surrounding springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife	3.11
Additional catalysts for valley's growth came from World War II	3.0
Both Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School which became Nellis Air Force Base and Nevada Test Site in north, and Basic Magnesium in nearby town of Henderson, arrived in early s as result of America's war effort	3.14
By , population had grown to almost , , with workers and airmen moving in at rapid pace	3.14
But this was not yet Las Vegas of folklore	2.9
During this period, East Coast Syndicate member Benjamin Bugsy Siegel earned foothold as local casino operator	3.0
Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become center of modern Las Vegas metropolis	3.1
But Mafia bosses who financed operation were displeased with its performance; Siegel was murdered in summer of	2.2
Despite its initial failings, Siegel's Flamingo survived him, as did mob infiltration of casinos	3.0
Freely flowing comps complimentary food, drink, and entertainment were order of day, with mob bosses content to provide environment of pleasurable excess as long as cash kept rolling in	3.0
While mob was running casinos, promoters were busily selling Las Vegas as glamorous Hollywood in desert	3.1
Many of them did	3.0
Frank Sinatra, Wayne Newton, and Louis Prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found themselves with names as big as marchquees on which they were written	3.1
For about years, Archaics thrived in culture that included many signs of early civilization	3.0
The Rat Pack, originally Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop, all in town to film Ocean's , landed at Sands in January for legendary stay	3.0
Other Hollywood stars came as well, simply because Las Vegas was place to be	3.0
As result, more casinos emerged along Strip	3.2
The Thunderbird, Desert Inn, Sahara, Sands, and Riviera hotels were erected during this period, luring curious clientele drawn by tales of allnight partying, exclusive entertainment, and cheap accommodations	3.1
There was no longer any question: when you wanted some unbridled adult fun, Las Vegas was place to be	3.11
New Legitimacy	3.11
Organized crime was soon to have formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas, corporate cash	2.89
Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through first millennium d, when Anasazi Indians inhabited valley	3.0
That would change dramatically with arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes	3.0
A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, style suited to Las Vegas ethos	3.2
True to myth, reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in Desert Inn's penthouse	2.83
Thus began Hughes' legendary Las Vegas buying spree	3.0
When it was over, Hughes owned casinos, airport, and airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from Strip to mountains	3.0
Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting	2.88
Because of new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into gaming business, and their influence helped draw line in desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant	3.1
Las Vegas with Vision	3.22
As corporations moved in and mob was slowly pushed out, new Las Vegas emerged	3.3
Far more progressive than Archaics, Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest	3.25
The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across US	3.0
Casino operators had to reassess nature of their business	2.89
The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, Las Vegas resident and owner of Golden Nugget	3.0
In mids, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with new resort	3.2
He bought several Strip properties, Silver Slipper and Castaways among them, and demolished them to make way for new kind of resort, Mirage, which became instant success	3.29
Wynn's casinos have also set new standards	3.0
They can no longer be just box filled with gaming tables, restaurants, and showroom	2.9
Excalibur, MGM Grand, Luxor, and New YorkNew York all followed Mirage's lead during s, offering themed environments and attractions for families	3.2
As evidence of everfaster nature of city, by middle of s new approach showed signs of backlash, with many visitors criticizing mediocrity of Las Vegas experience	2.6
This permitted Anasazi to achieve benchmarchk of advanced society, ability to live in permanent shelters yearround without need to follow wildlife	3.1
The latest approach is perhaps best of postmob era: comprehensive resort	3.0
New resorts offer attractions and amenities modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide, including luxurious spas, signature restaurants, and exclusive boutiques	3.5
Additionally, handful of resorts, such as SouthSeas themed Mandalay Bay, Mirage, and new Seasons, are now catering exclusively to luxury travel marchket	3.3
The crme de la crme of Las Vegas deluxe is Steve Wynn's Bellagio	3.1
Perhaps more important, such highend accommodations raise standards of expectations back to mythology of Rat Pack era	3.22
As it changed from mob gam bling town to corporate gaming venue, population of Las Vegas skyrocketed	3.1
With its new look and new aim, prospects are good despite warnings	3.6
Mysteriously, Anasazi vanished from valley around d , leaving it to be repopulated by Southern Paiutes, another huntergatherer tribe	3.0
Inevitably, some people will get burned in process, but others will rise triumphantly from fray to even greater successes	3.38
And that, more than anything, is constant that characterizes past, present, and future of Las Vegas	3.0
Unable to replicate agricultural techniques of Anasazi, Paiutes were destined to seminomadic lifestyle until European settlers arrived, changing nature of existence in valley forever	3.0
During this period, indigenous people lived in caves, hunting mammals that gathered at shoreline	3.0
From Mailmen to Mormons	3.0
In early nineteenth century, America's western territories were still largely unexplored	3.11
For years, Las Vegas was used as Spanish Trail waystation	3.0
A Brief History	3.0
In , American explorer John C Fremont parked his horses at Big Springs, and his report to government resulted in mail route leading past spot on its way to California	3.0
This put Las Vegas on map and was of crucial turning points of its history	3.0
In , Mormon leader Brigham Young responded to promising reports of Las Vegas by sending missionary settlers to valley; they eventually built fort not far from today's Downtown	3.0
Surrounded by acres of farmland hewn from hard desert, adobe fort became focal for development of Las Vegas for next years	3.0
The landscape of valley changed dramatically over next centuries	2.9
The missionaries struggled valiantly against dictates of desert, trying simultaneously to survive harshness of their circumstances and spread Mormon faith	2.7
Additional pressures from arriving miners pushed missionaries' plight beyond recovery	2.4
Their supplies scarce, their harvest meager, and their spirit broken, they abandoned fort in	2.2
opportunist who stayed was Octavius Decatur Gass	3.2
Bestowed with plenty of invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this day, Gass redirected his life by picking up where Mormons left off, at least when it came to ranching and farming	3.0
The glaciers feeding lake melted away and lake evaporated	3.0
Gass took over abandoned Mormon fort and acres hectares surrounding it, dubbing it Las Vegas Ranch	3.1
His determination had other results as well: Gass was named justice of peace and territorial legislator	3.25
Despite his ambition, Gass' success was shortlived	2.7
In late s, he defaulted on loan from rancher Archibald Stewart, so Stewart took Las Vegas Ranch for his own	2.8
Fossils tell obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development	3.0
Early Habitation	3.1
What happened next would marchk end of successful Las Vegas Ranch and beginning of era of subdivision seen across almost all of Western America to this day	2.88
Of Tracks and Tracts	3.0
At turn of th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were among burgeoning metropolises of new American West	3.1
Though cities remained unlinked by rail, this was about to change quickly	3.0
When it did, Las Vegas Valley which at time had nonnative population of less than would change as well	2.9
Around b c, native Archaic Indians began to develop lasting hunting and gathering culture	3.18
In , officials of San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas, eager to secure rightofway for their Los Angeles Salt Lake connection	3.14
Las Vegas would serve as major stopover for crew rest and train repair	3.12
For all this, railroad needed land	3.0
As mapped, track traveled directly through Helen Stewart's Las Vegas Ranch	3.14
Stewart sold percent of her ranch to railroad	3.2
In early , route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City was completed, and train tracks bore right down center of Las Vegas Valley	3.2
On May , railroad held land sale, momentous step in Las Vegas history	3.5
Standing at depot at Main and Fremont streets, railroad officials auctioned lots they had subdivided from square blocks of desert scrub	3.0
By this time, valley was in much same geographic state as it exists in today, with exception, presence of artesian springs that bubbled to surface in several areas	3.0
Las Vegas was no longer small pioneer settlement	3.0
With rail service in place and blocks of private property, it was ready to become real town	3.2
Businesses sprang up overnight, and wooden houses were erected to replace tent city in which many of early settlers had lived	3.1
year after auction, population of Las Vegas had ballooned to residents, portent of things to come for next years	3.12
Dam Good Luck	3.5
From beginning, Las Vegas was built to serve travelers	3.0
The inhabited history of Las Vegas Valley stretches to , b c, when much of area was covered by prehistoric lake	3.0
Growth continued for years, and by town had telephones, roundtheclock electricity, and growing population, many of whom worked in railroad repair shop	3.29
But such heady progress would soon come to halt	2.88
Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating Las Vegas repair facility	2.89
Additionally, Las Vegas had been made part of Nevada's new Clark County in , year when legislature also outlawed gambling	3.0
These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to status of small desert community that could no longer support its residents	2.44
But southwest's growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas's fortuitous proximity to Colorado River, would give Las Vegas second chance to achieve prosperity	3.22
Providing influx of to southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally	3.0
These springs fed network of streams draining through Las Vegas Wash to Colorado River	3.0
Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada	3.5
More Government Help	3.12
The construction of Hoover Dam did not singlehandedly save Las Vegas, however	2.88
They went to work on what has become of lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted	3.0
It did not take long for city to establish itself as wildWest town with anything goes attitude	2.9
Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day or night	3.0
Strangely enough, study also included pairs of biological brothers that were not twins, and out of homosexual males studied, only , or about , had homosexual brothers, which is approximately normal statistical incidence of homosexuality in general population Bailey Pillard	3.0
More and more people are beginning to believe that homosexuality is not choice, but rather feeling that is born with	3.2
As grows older, they become aware of sexual feelings towards other persons	3.1
The only difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals is that while heterosexuals are attracted to members of opposite sex, homosexuals are attracted to those of same sex	3.0
Therefore, neither homosexuals nor heterosexuals really have choice in matter, and asking homosexual Why are you attracted to other members of your sex is likened to asking heterosexual Why are you attracted to members of opposite sex?	3.0
Why are you attracted to other members of your sex	3.0
Why are you attracted to members of opposite sex?	3.0
After all, why would anyone choose such difficult lifestyle?	2.7
Rather, only actual choice is whether or not to be open with one's sexuality and sexual preference; whether to act on one's sexual desires, whether to tell others about such feelings, or whether to live whole life as lie and suppress these attractions Marcus	3.1
Both were asked how what they thought determined homosexuality nature vs nurture and why, when they realized they were homosexual and how they knew, and similar questions	3.0
Both believed that homosexual was result of nature, rather than nurture Dobbens Woods	2.9
Dobbens reasoned that most parents would not raise their children to be homosexual; They're not like'My child's going to be gay! '	2.8
My child's going to be gay! '	3.0
Dobbens	3.1
Dobbens believes that he was born homosexual	3.1
When why he was homosexual, he explained It's just way you are, you can not explain it, I was just born that way, it is like asking how world was made no really knows Dobbens	3.1
It's just way you are, you can not explain it, I was just born that way, it is like asking how world was made no really knows	3.1
He went on to explain that while his nurture did not impact his sexual orientation, it did affect his view of it	3.0
When discussing role of parents and upbringing in child's sexuality, he commented They can bring you up to be open minded to homosexuality , but they do not bring you up to be homosexual I grew up in place where homosexuality is accepted , so that is why I'm so open about being gay; I accept myself Whether or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual depends on how you are brought up Dobbens	3.0

Woods generally agreed with Dobbens, and justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by one's nature, rather than nurture, when he commented that there is nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to anything like homosexuality Woods	2.9
boyhood	3.0
In fact, Plato even considered love between members of same sex to be only real and lasting love and necessary for democracy	3.0
When asked why he was gay, he explained that it is simply something that I can not help embedded in my head; nothing made me do it Woods	3.0
He went on to explain that it same thing as primitive attraction between males and females, only it was between males and other males	2.9
He added that nothing happened to make me homosexual ; it is always been there	3.0
nothing happened to make me homosexual ; it is always been there I've always been attracted to guys	3.12
I've always been attracted to guys Woods	3.18
What I find to be extraordinary about Woods' case is that he remarchked how while he has always been sexually attracted go guys, he is romantically attracted to women in sense that he has always wanted girlfriend and to be close with other females, etc but never in sexual sense	3.0
Though he has always kind of fantasized about getting marchried to female , these feelings come from his romantic side, which is different from sexual side Woods	3.22
What, exactly, causes homosexuality?	3.0
always kind of fantasized about getting marchried to female ,	3.3
He says that if he marchried female with which he shared strong trust, maybe he could work it out	3.1
real and lasting love	4.12
It's like race It's all something you can not help; it all comes to you It's internal, you can not help it	2.7
It's all something you can not help; it all comes to you It's internal, you can not help it Woods	2.9
When asked if he thought homosexuality was caused by gene, he commented that he thought that it was more of instinct	2.9
He gave example of birds, which are born with instincts such as knowing how to build next, or catch their prey	3.0
Furthermore, there were many occurrences of homosexual behavior in Greek mythology; Hercules is rumored to have had male lovers, and Zeus himself partook in such behavior	3.2
Woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something in development of embryo	2.88
fascinating	3.8
His final thought: I also believe everyone has at least homosexual attraction	3.0
I also believe everyone has at least homosexual attraction It's not black and white homosexual vs heterosexual ; it is spectrum	3.0
It's not black and white homosexual vs heterosexual ; it is spectrum Woods	3.1
Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics	2.9
For instance, heterosexual males have average of times as many children as homosexual ones, as female is required to reproduce children, yet homosexuals are, by definition, not sexually attracted to females	3.0
Because consequently heterosexual men contribute times as much genetic information to next gene pool, if homosexuality was indeed caused by gene, it would have died out entirely by now, or at least been reduced immensely in number of occurrences	3.1
Since neither of these events have yet taken place, it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by gene Fulkerson	3.0
My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no definitive answer on what causes homosexuality	3.0
No knows for sure now although many think they do , and perhaps no ever will know whole truth	2.33
Nonetheless, I am apt to believe that homosexuality is product of some kind of combination of genetic and environmental causes	3.0
Even Homer wrote about Achilles and Patroclus, who have been considered to be perfect model of true love Emond	3.25
This is why Bailey and Pillard found in their study that while they was greatly elevated chance that males sharing same genetic makeup would also share same sexuality, this was not case of time	2.88
This seems to be most likely explanation as of now, but even as I write this, new studies are being done	3.0
Perhaps truth is right around corner	2.9

But it was not until that term homosexual was first used, to describe man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of same sex Marcus	3.0
At this in time, Karl Maria Kertbeny used word in pamphlet which fought to repeal current antihomosexual laws of Prussia	2.9
Kertbeny derived this word from Greek word for same and Latin word for sex, whereas heterosexual is person whose feelings of sexual attraction are for opposite sex Marcus	3.0

Hirschfeld also founded Scientific Humanitarian committee, which was mostly homosexual, in	3.0
He became known as of founding fathers of sexology, and furthered this position when he opened world's first sexological institute, institute for Sexual Science in Berlin, in , which was destroyed by Nazis years later	2.9
Still more would claim that it is mental illness that can and should be cured	2.9
The debate over homosexuality has been of most longlasting and controversial ones ever	2.9
Hirschfeld largely supported Urning theory of Karl Ulrichs, with minor additions; he believed in some hormonal theories as cause of homosexuality, but this only led to unsuccessful attempts to cure homosexuals with use of hormone injections	2.7
This theory, which defined Urnings as males who turned to other males as sexual partners, was published in pamphlets by Ulrichs, starting in	2.83
The first, Vindex, defended Urnings, while second, Inclusa, which followed shortly after, described first scientific theory of homoerotic desire	3.0
hermaphrodites of mind,	2.9
Perhaps then, it is combination of some of these?	3.1
This, he claimed, made laws such as paragraph , law adopted by King William I throughout German Kingdoms at time of their unification which forbade sex between males, and forced criminal penalties upon individuals partaking in such behavior, unfair and unreasonable	2.9
A couple years after Plato and Homer, Sigmund Freud still believed homosexuality to be natural behavior	2.9
In interview in , he professed his beliefs: I am of firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people Homosexual persons are not sick	2.67
I am of firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people Homosexual persons are not sick They also do not belong in court of law!	2.87
They also do not belong in court of law!	2.18
In , he furthered his claims when he wrote now famous Letter to American Mother of homosexual, which stated that Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it can not be classified as illness Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals qtd in Isay	3.0
Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it can not be classified as illness Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals	3.2
However, general public of s and early s, including medical professionals, regarded homosexuality as curable mental illness	2.8
Treatments such as castration, hysterectomy, lobotomy, and electroshock therapy were used as attempted cures	2.8
By mid s, psychotherapy became most common cure, and many homosexuals spent countless hours being analyzed in hopes of changing their sexual preference Dudley	2.62
Dr Evelyn Hooker, heterosexual psychologist, conducted groundbreaking study in mid s that went along similar reasoning as Freud	3.22
In this courageous experiment, Hooker compared psychological profiles of men, half homosexual and half heterosexual	3.0
She disagreed with popular belief at time that homosexuality was mental illness, and concluded that there was no significant psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men; gay men were no more insane than their straight counterparts Marcus	2.8
Documented homosexuality dates as far back as ancient Greece and other cultures of time, where it was considered to be very normal and natural occurrence Emond	3.2
Fortunately, many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not illness, and their lobbying, along with innovemberative study performed by Hooker, who has been referred to as Rosa Parks of gay movement convinced American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as mental illness in December of	3.0
Rosa Parks of gay movement	3.0
Just over year later, American Psychological Association also removed homosexuality from their list of mental illnesses Marcus	3.44
The American Psychological Association further reiterated this belief when overwhelming majority of Council of Representatives adopted Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation in , which publicly chastised those who attempted to cure homosexuality by means of various forms of treatment	3.0
cure	3.6
It stated, rather that homosexuality was merely difference in opinion and values of common person, but must still be respected as individual orientation, and thus treated as Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation	3.1
Perhaps of most famous studies on this topic was concluded in by Michael Bailey, assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University, and Richard Pillard, associate professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine, and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics	3.0
For years, these men studied number of occurrences of homosexuality in both monozygotic, or identical twins set of twins coming from same fertilized egg and thus having identical DNA , and dizygotic, or fraternal twins set of twins from too septemberarate zygotes, causing them to have similar DNA, but not any more so than that of ordinary siblings , in addition to adoptive brothers of gay males meaning that all of these males would have been raised in same environment	3.0
In his book The Symposium, Plato wrote Those who are halves of man whole pursue males, and being slices, so to speak, of male, love men throughout their boyhood, and take pleasure in physical contact with men qtd in Isay	3.0
In total, pairs of twins identical and fraternal and sets of male and their adopted brothers were studied, where at least of had been classified as homosexual, either by selfidentification or other means	3.0
Those who are halves of man whole pursue males, and being slices, so to speak, of male, love men throughout their boyhood, and take pleasure in physical contact with men	3.09
Out of homosexual males who had identical twins, , or approximately of their identical twin brothers were also found to be homosexual, as compared to only , or approximately of nonidentical twins of homosexual males, and , or approximately of adopted brothers of homosexual males who were unrelated in terms of genetics	3.0
Me, I found space suit, but it was statistically unlikely that I, and whomever else has followed suit pun intended , would manage to repair our ship before hours are up; yes, studies have been done	2.8

I believe we will see end of universe,	2.78
I believe we will see end of universe, said Tiffany	2.8
Captain's cohort, she had glass of orangebrown liquid in hand; it might have been orange juice and some kind of berry liquor	3.0
She swirled it speculatively	3.1
I watched Adrienne	3.12
Impossible,	2.6
Impossible, said Zheng, sitting in chair to her left	3.0
Maybe universe will end sooner than you think,	2.5
He did not drink, but he made of mingling with all various cliques	3.0
Maybe we will travel at speed of light and we will not age,	3.11
Maybe we will travel at speed of light and we will not age, said Sarah, setting her wine glass on little round end table by her couch	3.2
Maybe we are already traveling at speed of light	3.5
Relatively says it all	3.0
Zheng scoffed	2.7
Also impossible	2.5
Also impossible Even if we were traveling at percent of speed of light, that is assuming you ignore science and pretend that such thing is possible, because it is not, we would still age We'd just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us	2.8
And?	3.0
said Sarah	2.9
Aging is relative, anyway	3.1
Aging is relative, anyway Besides, I would not mind being around forever Give our ancestors purpose Keep their dreams alive	3.2
Besides, I would not mind being around forever	3.4
New hypothesis,	3.25
No one's immortal In fact, opposite: We're all going to die	2.4
In fact, opposite: We're all going to die	1.9
Bleak,	2.11
Bleak, commented Zheng	2.73
But I like it	3.9
We're all going to die, so what better thing to do than enjoy time we have?	2.9
Kishori gestured to bar, carpets, paintings	3.0
All luxuries money can buy	3.22
All luxuries money can buy,	3.9
All luxuries money can buy, she echoed	3.44
And accompanying bell, I saw light	3.1
Paid for how?	2.75
Smuggling,	2.62
Matteroffact	3.12
Jefferson snorted, amused	3.6
Think about it, Kishori continued, where else would we get money to buy all this?	3.0
where else would we get money to buy all this?	3.1
Renegade smugglers	2.25
Renegade smugglers So what is our cargo, eh, captain?	2.78
So what is our cargo, eh, captain?	3.0
Zheng joked, leaning back in his chair with his glass of wine	3.3
Jefferson shook his head and stood up	2.9
I'll leave you to your speculation,	3.0
I'll leave you to your speculation, he said	2.9
Now, there were things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense	2.63
A chorus of good nights followed him out door	3.3
After captain left, Zheng leaned in	3.0
He set his glass down on end table, steepled his fingers together	2.8
We're revolting, he told us	2.6
And I do not mean that you disgust me	2.45
And I do not mean that you disgust me No, we are start of rebellion Did you hear what captain said earlier? He means, we are going to change future The universe as we know it will not be same	3.13
No, we are start of rebellion	2.9
The universe as we know it will not be same	2.6
Would n't we know it if we were part of rebellion?	3.0
Zheng shook his head	2.86
The captain selected us for reason He has inside intelligence, how else would he know where to find us? He knows about us	3.1
He has inside intelligence, how else would he know where to find us?	3.1
He knows about us	2.89
That's still dumb,	2.0
That's still dumb, said Sarah	2.2
Inside intelligence?	3.11
Inside intelligence? Do n't you remember, there is not exactly big galactic government from which to steal information	3.0
Do n't you remember, there is not exactly big galactic government from which to steal information	3.0
First, whole inavacuum why'sthereabell thing	3.0
Jefferson did not share how he found people	2.6
He did not share how he knew exactly where wrecks were, or why he saved some people but not others	2.88
But then again, no asked	3.0
He had been at this savior business longer than any of us	3.0
I wondered if Adrienne would ask about that	2.9
We're going to mean something,	3.38
We're going to mean something, Zheng was saying	3.33
What we do, rebelling against oppression of many governments that oppose us, we are going to leave legacy	3.3
He sounded certain	3.11
Enthusiastic, even	3.6
Ray, he shook his head, and broke quiet he would held most of evening	2.82
You've got it all wrong	2.3
He looked from Sarah, to Adrienne, to Zheng, to Kishori and Tiffany, to me	2.9
Obviously, we can not last longer than rest of universe	2.7
All we are doing is existing	3.0
We are not special	2.62
Again, bleak,	2.2
Again, bleak, commented Zheng	2.6
Adrienne gestured for him to be quiet	2.7
She leaned forward, setting her elbows on foot stool in front of her	3.0
You never know when it will end,	2.89
You can not hold on forever, even if you do not ever, ever want to forget	2.57
How long until memories slip away?	2.4
How long until all you remember is this, ship, thick red carpeting, chandeliers, empty conversations you hold with other shells who used to be people?	2.6
I wondered how long Ray had been on this ship	3.1
I wondered why, if he had such unpropitious outlook, he had not tried to change his situation	2.62
I wanted to ask, but he was still talking, and I was too selfconscious to interrupt	2.9
You can try to hold on,	2.8
You can try to hold on, said Ray	2.7
You can try and try and try	2.9
Repeat stories to yourself in artificial night, sketch faces in your mind	3.0
But words, if you repeat them enough times, lose their meaning	2.7
My wife's name, once	2.88
These signals were heralds of my saviors	3.3
Repeat it enough times, it is just sound	2.8
No longer grounded	3.75
Ray, he said, If we last forever, if our eyes are last eyes watching as stars blink out, it will not mean thing to us	3.1
If we last forever, if our eyes are last eyes watching as stars blink out, it will not mean thing to us We will not care that we are last and we will not care that there are no more stars We are not angels We're just dumb and lucky	3.1
Pure dumb luck,	2.7
Pure dumb luck, he said	3.0
Struck nerve, huh?	2.7
said Zheng	2.88
Sorry,	2.43
Sorry, said Ray	2.7
How long ago was that?	3.0
asked Adrienne	3.0
Leaving your wife, I mean	2.56
Leaving your wife, I mean Traveling on this ship	2.89
The first words they said to me meant nothing	2.7
I do not know,	2.5
I do not know, he said	2.86
We were all quiet for moment	2.73
We let him go	3.2
Silent	2.9
Selfconscious	2.6
More excuses were made, and after few moments, only Adrienne and I were left sitting in ballroom	2.72
She looked across circle of couches at me	3.0
she asked me	3.1
I shrugged	2.5
How long have you been here?	3.0
I was not listening; I did not care; I was going to live; I was going to keep breathing	3.2
Not that long,	3.0
Not that long, I said	3.0
A couple weeks, I guess Maybe month or two	3.0
Why do not you know for sure?	2.67
she asked	3.0
I shrugged	2.9
I had not been counting days	2.9
What did you do before this?	3.0
What did you do before this? How were you found?	3.0
How were you found?	3.2
I was engineer	3.09
I explained how my ship had malfunctioned, no warning at all	2.88
The explosions, impossible rescue	2.7
She nodded	3.14
The ship I was on, I guess that is what happened, too	3.0
The ship I was on, I guess that is what happened, too Some vital part broke, and well, boom It was all so fast	2.8
Some vital part broke, and	2.3
well, boom	2.9
It was all so fast	3.0
Fact: Sound is vibration	2.9
I'm going to figure it out,	3.11
How and why this ship exists	2.9
How and why this ship exists I'll figure it out, then I'm going to find way home	3.0
I paced my room that night, unable to sleep	2.1
Next to those, nothing else mattered	2.82
Worse, Adrienne had made this clear to me with single question	2.7
Fact: Adrienne intimidated me	2.0
Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns	2.9
I resolved to break pattern	3.14
Another evening, another chandeliered room, another swirl of conversations and dances and hor d'oevres	3.3
Has anyone ever left?	3.0
Adrienne looked at each of us in turn	3.0
Ray exchanged glance with Zheng	3.0
Sarah frowned	2.6
Now that you mention it, I have not seen Alexis in days	2.3
Now that you mention it, I have not seen Alexis in days I assumed he was indisposed	2.75
After first whoosh of air being sucked away, there was lightning, but no thunder	2.9
I assumed he was indisposed	2.88
Kishori nodded in agreement	3.18
I looked at Ray and raised eyebrow	2.9
What?	2.88
Well,	3.0
Well, Ray said, slowly, People do leave	2.6
People do leave The approximate number of people at any given event is always same But we see new faces	2.82
The approximate number of people at any given event is always same	3.0
You're sure it is not just some people being indisposed?	2.8
asked Adrienne, using Sarah's phrasing	3.0
Keep adding people long enough, regardless, you get more overall	2.86
A couple people staying in their rooms, even if you switch out people, will not make difference	2.8
He dropped pecans back into dish, by one	3.0
So where do they go?	3.0
Adrienne focused on Zheng	2.88
I cut in	2.86
Maybe better question is, does anyone ever come back?	3.0
Kishori chewed her lip	3.0
Sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink	2.8
After moment, Ray said, I do not think so	2.75
Are there patterns?	3.0
Adrienne asked	3.0
Who leaves?	2.9
Again, there was uncomfortable moment of silence	2.36
I hazarded guess	3.0
You do not notice, do you	2.8
Of course we notice	3.0
But well, no important ever disappears, so it does not really matter, does it	3.0
I could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left, and failing	2.6
No offered different answer	3.0
I looked at Adrienne	3.0
Mission accomplished: Our routine insouciance had been disrupted	3.43
I reserved right to revise this opinion later	3.0
How long have you been here?	2.9
The question, previously posed to me, was presented to rest of our group excluding Ray; Adrienne had been tactful enough to wait until he had gone for refill, recalling last time subject was broached	2.75
Sarah, she tilted her head and tapped finger on side of her wine glass	3.12
A long time	3.0
Got to be months and months, at least	3.0
You were here before I was,	3.0
You were here before I was, said Kishori, and so was Tiffany	3.1
When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue, I looked around	2.7
I looked at Zheng; he shrugged	2.9
Time passes in weird way here	3.0
Time passes in weird way here I kept track for while, days, but after that I guess I did not see point	2.8
I kept track for while, days, but after that	2.9
I guess I did not see point	2.6
Fact: Some places are timeless	3.1
asked Adrienne	3.0
Days do not matter,	3.0
Days do not matter, he said	2.4
Tiffany nodded, but Kishori spoke before other woman could	2.89
she asked Adrienne	3.0
Adrienne met her gaze	3.12
But we are not here forever,	3.0
But we are not here forever, objected Sarah	2.87
Remember?	3.1
Disappeared, I corrected her	2.9
We do not know how or why he left	2.3
We do not know how or why he left Or where he went	2.7
Or where he went	3.0
Zheng looked thoughtful	3.14
The ship, it was odd and old, either so outdated or so heavily modified that I could not tell what make it was, and somehow, crew standing around me fit same description, singularly atypical amalgamation of folk	2.78
He picked up his glass, swirled liquid around, took sip, then set glass back down	3.0
He glanced around at rest of us	2.9
Do you want to leave?	3.0
Could you live anywhere else now?	2.8
I spoke up	3.22
Yes,	3.3
Yes, I said	3.29
I would not miss this, much	2.8
No else said anything	2.82
I watched Adrienne's eyes move from face to next	2.8
Zheng, he addressed me again, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and intense, steady gaze	2.9
You think that,	3.0
You think that, he said, but is it true?	3.0
but is it true? Would you be happy back in normal life, working and living and crying in drudgery of whatever hell normal is these days?	2.67
Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns	2.86
Fact: I was not sure I wanted dream stage to end	3.0
My quarters felt stifling	2.22
Asphyxiating my mind	2.6
I sat sideways in armchair, feet dangling over arm, neck resting against other, absently tracing invisible lines between stars outside my window as I ruminated on situation	2.9
There was schedule advertising upcoming onship events, such as dance classes, craft sessions, and discussion groups, and list of dinner invitations for me to respond to	3.1
A menu of display options, allowing me to customize all lightscreen's superficial characteristics	2.9
A simple contact system for communicating with other people on ship	2.9
That was all	3.0
A methodical search of my adjoining rooms, ample closet space, and attached bathroom facility had similarly provided no fodder	2.7
I was discouraged and frustrated	2.2
I wanted to prove to Adrienne that I wanted solve ship's mystery just as much as she did	3.12
I wanted to find something, anything, that would prove all this was normal and sane	2.86
And me, I guess I was more piece in their puzzle	2.8
I did not want to think about disappearances and time and purposes and consequences	2.67
In hand I balanced my plate of starshaped crackers, globs of elegant dips and garnishes, little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale green plant, and array of other delectable, bitesized items	3.4
My other hand pointedly steered Adrienne to small table against wall	3.1
She glared at me, but obediently let me pull her along	3.0
I was more scrap to weld onto rest, more stranded survivor who was found	2.63
Tell me,	2.8
what you have found	3.0
She gave me grumpy look that informed me, quite clearly, of her current opinion of me	2.25
Not if you are going to be rude about it	1.9
I sighed	2.2
Sorry	2.3
I was not, not really, but I'd lie to get conversation going	3.12
I explained, in brief sentences, my earlier impasse	3.0
I do not know much,	2.6
I heard captain say something yesterday, as I walking to Pyrope Parlor I was just coming up on corner and he was around other side, talking to couple people, and they must not have known I was there He said something about wreck going well And listen, when they came round corner, Ray was with captain	2.9
I was just coming up on corner and he was around other side, talking to couple people, and they must not have known I was there	2.8
He said something about wreck going well	3.0
The next time captain stopped by our group, Tiffany tagging along pretending that she, too, was social butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone , we were ready	3.0
I was now of them	3.12
Is there doctoberor on board?	2.8
I've been having headaches	2.27
This story, it is our story	3.0
Jefferson nodded	3.0
Down past Emerald Lounge, second door on left	3.0
Down past Emerald Lounge, second door on left All hours	3.12
All hours	2.89
A robot, then	3.0
Medical AI were even more expensive than barkeep	2.5
I wondered how many people it treated	3.12
Had anyone on ship ever fallen seriously ill?	2.9
Does he age?	3.0
asked Adrienne	3.0
The captain?	3.0
I never thought about it	3.0
Adrienne steepled her fingers and studied my face	3.0
Hotel California	3.0
That does not answer my question,	2.38
Adrienne only picked at her food	2.56
Not hungry?	3.0
No,	2.2
No, said Adrienne	2.25
At least have drink, said Sarah	3.0
said Kishori	3.0
Maybe that is problem,	2.6
Maybe that is problem, said Sarah	2.75
and is magic number,	3.2
and is magic number, said Sarah	3.1
Well, we have got perfectsize group right here	3.38
Just enough for us all to be able to barely avoid killing each other	2.6
Why does not anyone mutiny?	2.8
Adrienne asked	3.09
We can not,	2.3
Adrienne shook her head and made sound of disgust	1.62
You could force captain to set down somewhere	2.75
You could force captain to set down somewhere Let us off ship If he refuses, threaten him If he still refuses, well, of all of us, is not there someone who can drive ship?	2.3
Let us off ship	2.9
If he still refuses, well, of all of us, is not there someone who can drive ship?	2.9
Floating alone, each of us facing silence of vacuum, we were found	3.0
That's murder,	2.1
That's murder, objected Sarah	2.3
That's survival,	3.0
That's survival, Adrienne corrected her	2.88
Do you want to be stuck here for rest of your life?	2.1
I shifted my feet in plush green carpeting of Emerald Lounge, looking out windows at stars	3.5
Times like that, running on less sleep than I should, alone because everyone else had had sense to retire for night, I had tendency to get all meditative about universe and my place in it	3.0
The stillness of room contributed, as did view	3.0
All of it was temporary, save for black	2.8
Once found, we can never be lost	3.4
Everything to fade away, lost as dust and scattered atoms between stars, and every of us to be left as alone as moment we were born	2.6
Eyes bulging in panic, but no screams	2.5
Some things in this world, we have to make them permanent ourselves	2.91
He had made us constant	3.0
He made this ship, this life, constant	3.11
The thing that was known	3.0
The thing that would not change	2.9
Maybe everything we did, all stories we told, maybe it was all lies	2.5
We can never leave	2.38
But ultimately, this ship, its purpose, our purpose, did it matter?	2.91
We each had our own theory	3.13
Maybe that was enough	2.9
So, I'm on ship now?	3.0
So, I'm on ship now? You do this lot?	3.0
Maybe that made us more real	3.2
Maybe it made us feel less alone	2.89
Mind if I join you?	3.1
I turned to see Adrienne in doorway	3.1
She smiled, then crossed room to join me by window, not waiting for answer	3.67
You do this lot?	3.0
I can not see meaning in any of it All these things I do, they are just to pass time until I die	2.12
All these things I do, they are just to pass time until I die	2.38
You do not see meaning because there is no meaning, she said	3.0
A woman, introduced as Tiffany and neither tall nor beautiful, shrugged	2.8
After all of it, as much as we feared being alone, we feared being vulnerable even more	2.6
Our instinct was to hide	2.8
Look what I found,	3.44
Look what I found, Adrienne said	3.3
In her hands was bottle	2.92
And what happens to Adrienne?	3.0
Jefferson was in Captain's Lounge,	3.14
The speed of sound in dry air at degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit is and meters per second, or feet per second	3.0
Up his dosage,	3.0
Up his dosage, I heard captain say	3.0
I ran	2.66
I did not want to forget	2.7
The last thing I remember, I was tearing down corridors	2.7
Now and then	3.0
Every ship had life boats	3.0
In case of emergency, break glass	3.0
I'd find one	3.0
What about my crewmates?	3.0
Some other ship	3.0
Any place but this place	2.5
Failing all else, I'd suffocate	1.75
Alone	2.4
Ray, he caugustht me as I pounded on corridor walls, finding no glass to break	2.8
Relax,	3.37
Why did not you save them?	2.75
It'll pass, he told me	3.13
He held me in his arms until I stopped flailing	3.0
I can never leave	2.45
As much as Jesse had irritated me, I did not like picture my brain drew of him floating in his grave, body swollen and bloated	2.2
Who would tell his girl how he had died?	2.37
Could n't, said captain	2.7
Jefferson, he called himself, cleanshaven and smarcht, picture of perfect entrepreneur	3.2
An opportunist and businessman, that was Jefferson	3.1
We're selective about our passengers,	3.0
We're selective about our passengers, he continued	3.1
Such relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter about his girl back on Earth and that allexpensespaid she won last time he was on leave	3.0
You fit bill	3.3
You fit bill They did not	3.2
They did not	2.67
Tiffany, she looked at captain, grinned and flipped her greasy brown locks over her shoulder	3.33
She turned to me	3.0
Come on,	2.89
Come on, she said, before I could say anything else, let us get you settled in	3.2
let us get you settled in	3.4
No time for questions	2.63
No time for answers	2.86
The ship had all usual accoutrements artificial gravity, tastefully painted walls, sound dampeners to keep noise of engines from driving crew batshit insane, recycled air systems , and few lessusual: lush carpeting, lighting that was decemberorative as well as functional, spacious corridors	3.29
Glimpses of elegant rooms down branching hallways; music; voices; aroma of real food	3.4
This was heaven	3.8
No virgins, but it would do	3.0
Tiffany looked back	3.0
To your quarters	3.0
To your quarters It's not far; you are not going to get blisters	3.1
It's not far; you are not going to get blisters	2.86
No, I meant, where is ship going?	3.0
No, I meant, where is ship going? What's our destination?	2.9
What's our destination?	3.0
Tiffany, she stopped walking	2.8
Sound travels as mechanical wave through medium, and in space, there is no medium	3.0
Honey,	3.5
You're going to be delighted Destination everywhere Destination nowhere	3.7
Destination everywhere	3.18
This was hell	1.8
Fact: The speed of sound in dry air at degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit is and meters per second, or feet per second	3.1
I mean, sure, I'd had my moment of elation when I had first realized I'd been rescued, but it did not sink in	3.5
After watching my ship tear apart, after spending good hours floating in silence in wreck, wondering whether I was currently facing stars belonging to constellation Libra or constellation Orion when those stars were viewed from Earth, wondering what it felt like to suffocate, and after feeling that yes, I was in fact going to die alone in space had sunk in, it took time for that feeling to dissipate	2.12
Fact: I was not dead	3.1
After I realized this, I left my quarters	2.88
It had not seemed relevant, somehow, given that I was still reeling over explosion, deaths of my crewmates, and rescue	2.4
I've heard there are number of stages of grief and shock; I guess I was working my way through them	2.0
Initially, I could not figure out why, I had not requested any be sent	2.7
Then I realized, someone must have noticed I had not left, and was nice enough to send food my way	3.4
The accompanying bottle of wine was nice touch	3.75
I must have consumed it, too, because later on, plates and bottle were both empty	3.0
I spent lot of time lying on my back on bed, staring up at little etched swirls in ceiling, or slumped in oldfashioned armchair, staring out windows at stars	2.86
I did lot of staring and not moving	2.9
Fact: Hell is other people	2.17
Sure, ship was spacious	3.38
But we were all on this ship, and we were on it together	3.2
Metaphorically, of course	3.0
The plate, by way, was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish, paprilikadusted deviled eggs, toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese, and balls of meat smothered in tomatobased sauce	3.11
Luxurious, even compared to fare would find in highclass space stations and pleasure cruisers	3.2
Compared to what mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship, it was mouthwateringly, lipsmackingly gorgeous	3.86
I decemberided it could not have been	2.7
Liking taste of sweet life, eh?	3.8
Liking taste of sweet life, eh? I'm Sarah, and this is Alexis, you must be new pickup	3.67
I'm Sarah, and this is Alexis, you must be new pickup	3.22
She looked me over approvingly	3.33
Come on, let us get you glass of champagne	3.37
It turned toward Sarah's wave and acknowledged her with nod, moments later setting fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her	3.4
I marchveled at robot's smoothness and coordination	3.45
Clearly, it was highend model	3.2
Sarah transferred glass to my free hand and pulled me away from bar for more introductions, with Alexis trailing after us	3.18
I spent evening listening, mostly	3.0
Listening and stuffing my face with all bits of fine food provided	3.12
No minded; Sarah's inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter	3.2
Ray, plump man who was grey where he was not bald	3.1
Zheng, short and dark and lean, with very intense gaze	3.1
He made me little uncomfortable	2.29
Kishori, petite, her hair strung out in series of braids that reached nearly to her waist	3.1
Most of their chatter was meaningless to me, stories of daytoday activities, how soandso had been seen in soandso's table at lunch and my was not that surprise, and why had not chef concoctobered this delectable selection of appetizers for dance other night, but of course those rolled meat pastries reminded of pastries back on Earth, did not they, and this was somehow interesting fact	2.88
After first halfhour, I stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight	3.0
Pretty cool, right?	3.62
In fact, as I recall, they got over Facebook fans	3.3
Google TGI Friday's Fan Woody and it looks pretty good	3.5
But then something not so awesome happened	2.1
All those fans wanted their free burgers and they wanted them now!	2.89
TGI Friday's completely lost control of page and eventually doled out lot of free burgers	2.9
Now from short term perspective I'm sure they did ok on deal	3.0
People came in and ate their food	3.2
But they could have accomplished that with coupons in mail, newspaper or by email list	3.0
But they decemberided to go Social Media route	3.0
Oh, numbers look good, but when you dig little deeper different picture emerges	3.0
Apparently Woody and his , fans went poof	2.7
How come?	2.86
I'm guessing it had something to do with venom and general anarchy page had created by buying fans rather than growing them	2.9
A TGI Friday's Facebook page does exist, with roughly third of fans they used to have	3.0
TGI Friday's pretty much had to spray Agent Orange on their relationship with , people	2.4
I think plenty of brands have heard siren call of Facebook ads	2.88
You paid Facebook for right to target them	2.89
Walls filled with off topic conversations at best, vile language and real antipathy for brand at worst	2.57
This sets up pattern where consumer now expects to be rewarded for being your fan with tangible item, that is, free stuff	2.9
That's not bonus item, it is now standard part of agreement	3.18

He's also very astute individual who understands how to use media and various communication channels to his advantage	3.1

James now finds himself in following position:	3.0
Winning title is expected immediately wherever he goes	3.22
Winning title will result in some saying that he could not do it alone	3.0

I'm no longer target demographic for most of products Lebron endorses, but you know what matters to me?	2.7
Winning championships	3.9

Let's see what future holds for Lebron	3.12
We know he will be rich, but how will he be viewed by fans across country	3.0
Perhaps Lebron should have hired Chief Culture Officer along with his coterie of other advisors	2.88
Make sure it is clear that team comes first and that he is looking forward to being part of team	3.4
That only thing that matters is winning championship	3.3
That that was main factor	3.0

What is even more shocking, is that more than animals die these cruel, painful deaths each year	2.3
needless deaths that could have been stopped!	1.7
And with so much animal cruelty and suffering going on, I'm sure you can understand why work of The Humane Society of United States is so vitally important and why we need support of many other people, like you, to help us bring end to animal suffering, abuse and neglect	2.3

Prosperity has brought with it new emphasis on historic preservation	3.14
You can view artifacts from Bronze Age, trace history of Easter Rising, or revisit Leopold Bloom's odyssey in Ulysses	3.1
Old buildings are being recycled; for example, thcentury Royal Hospital now holds Museum of Modern Art	3.2
And Dublin, city large in expectations, is still small enough for visitor to see most of its sights on foot	3.0
New construction is everywhere, streets buzz, traffic is increasingly congested, and in frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in Dublin seems intent on changing places with everyone else	2.7
City on Liffey	3.1
The River Liffey flows from west to east through center of city to Dublin Bay	3.1
The river forms natural line between north and south sections of city	2.78
Historically and culturally this northsouth distinction has always been significant, and it still is today, with dose of goodhumored rivalry between areas	3.0
I never go north of Liffey,	3.0
I never go north of Liffey, man remarchked	3.0
Farther out, both north and south, are sweeping curves of Royal and Grand Canals	3.0
The occasional cry of gulls and unexpected distant vistas will remind you that Dublin is by sea, and Wicklow mountains, which hold Dublin closely to coast, are visible from everywhere	3.33
Dublin is intimate city, physically small but tightly packed, perfect place for walking	3.25
College Green, home of Trinity College, provides natural focus just south of O'Connell Street bridge	3.1
Dublin and Dubliners	3.0
O'Connell Street, city's grand boulevard, leads north to Parnell Square	3.0
To south and east is St Stephen's Green and Georgian Dublin where national museums are located	3.22
Along Liffey to west is Temple Bar, center of nightlife and home to many of Dublin's cuttingedge artists and artistic endeavors	3.09
Up hill from Temple Bar are Dublin Castle and Christ Church Cathedral	3.0
The climate here can best be described as changeable and yet sudden shifts from light to dark, sunshine to shower, are part of city's magic	3.14
Buildings seem to transform themselves depending on light; Dublin under lowering sky is different place from Dublin in sunshine	3.1
Enjoying Dublin	3.88
Joyce, high priest of literary Modernism, imagined and interpreted Dublin for world in Ulysses you will see references to it all over	2.9
At night streets are crowded with people bent on having good time	3.6
The city's impact on rock and pop music scene with likes of U and Bob Geldof is well known, there is even selfguided tour of their haunts	3.1
Traditional Irish music is also alive and well, especially in pubs, and there has been revival of storytelling, poetry reading, and traditional dancing	3.5
Prosperity is in air; roar of Celtic Tiger can clearly be heard	3.38
Many shops, and also hotels and guest houses, have been owned and managed by same families for years, and theirs is welcome of traditional Dublin hospitality	3.3
There was time when you might have apologized for it, but no longer	2.71
Dublin has international restaurants galore, and New Irish Cuisine is built upon fresh products of Ireland's seas, rivers, and farms	3.38
But this is not whole picture	2.75
Coffee has replaced ubiquitous tea, Dublin is now almost as much coffee city as Vienna or Seattle	3.2
City and Countryside	3.1
In city of such human proportions it is not surprising that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation	3.22
Phoenix Park in northwest is largest open space, but squares like St Stephen's Green are garden oases of city	3.29
As capital of Europe's most explosive economy, Dublin seems to be changing before your very eyes	3.2
On coast, Sandymount, Dollymount, and Killiney strands are places to go	3.25

This busy, modern European city sits on years of history, history is present everywhere, from elegant Merrion Square to bullet holes on General Post Office	3.0
The DART Dublin Area Rapid Transit runs north and south along coast	3.0
It's ideal way for visitor to reach outlying sights and villages	3.12
Young at Heart?	3.22
Dublin is young city	2.9
Almost half of Ireland's population is under and with its universities and professional schools, Dublin also has large student population	3.0
The universities attract students from all over world, and this influx helps to make Dublin busy, buzzing international city	3.44
Unemployment is at alltime low	3.5
The Irish are actually beginning to come home	3.2
It's also city of imagination, reinvented and reappraised in literature of its exiles	3.0

Today Hong Kong remains capitalist enclave with its laws and rights intact, and China has promised that Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least years	2.89
Beijing's announced policy of maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability makes sense	3.43
Hong Kong has long been China's handiest window on West, and city is unrivaled in its commercial knowhow and managerial expertise	3.0
The impression of visitor today will be that very little has changed	3.0
Establishments are no longer called Royal, Queen Elizabeth has vanished from coinage, and Union Jack has been replaced by flag of China and new Hong Kong flag with its bauhinia flower	2.9
But in fact, there have been changes, many of them due to economic progress, new construction, and other factors that influence cities all over world	3.12
Others are more subtle	3.1
British social customs are still evident in kind of polite service you get in hotels and in long lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour	3.1
The British population has decemberreased; today there are as many American and Australian expats as there are British	2.88
With population of nearly and total area of just over , square km square miles , housing is of Hong Kong's perennial nightmarches	2.63
Hong Kong is crowded, it has of world's greatest population densities	2.8
Hong Kong and Its People	3.0
Whole cities have been created in New Territories, although unimaginative architecture of these towns has been criticized	2.71
But it is also efficient, with of best transportation systems anywhere, and for such crowded place, quiet, you do not hear voices raised in anger, motorists sitting on their horns, or loud boomboxes	3.0
Old customs are still followed: Fate and luck are taken very seriously, and astrologers and fortunetellers do steady business	3.0
Before skyscraper can be built, feng shui see page investigation must take place to ensure that site and building will promote health, harmony, and prosperity	3.0
You'll also notice that gambling is passion, whether it be cards, mahjong, lottery, or horses	3.1

Sightseeing in Hong Kong starts at sea level with enthralling water traffic, mix of freighters, ferries, tugs, juneks, and yachts	3.22
From Victoria Peak, Hong Kong's highest point, or from skyscrapers and hotels, they are especially exciting at night when lights are on	3.3
The business and financial center and signature soaring architecture are on Hong Kong Island	3.3
Beyond, in New Territories, are mixture of highrise suburban towns, ancient sites and walled villages, country parks, and farms with ducks and fish ponds	3.0
Hong Kong's other, less developed islands, Lantau, Lamma, and Cheung Chau, provide getaways	3.2
You can also take ferry to Macau to find entirely different kind of city, unique blend of Chinese and Iberian culture	3.5
It's anyone's guess what may happen in future, but for now Hong Kong bristles with energy and ambition, and for visitor, this beautiful city with its contrasts and variety is exhilarating experience	3.57
You'll find Hong Kong easy to get around, people helpful, English spoken everywhere, and food that lives up to its reputation	3.3
On July, British Crown Colony of Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty as Special Administrative Region of People's Republic of China	3.14
Which it frequently is not	2.8
But this post is not about how melancholy I become when I have not heard from her by p m which would be midnight over there , because anyone who follows me on Facebook already knows that and because this post concerns Urbino, not my daily descent into emo	2.56
As you probably noticed, my wife is currently on vacation without me , which is different than vacation from me, although given how frequently insufferable I am, I could understand appeal of such, in le Marche region of Italy, which is immediately south of Tuscany and full of communists	2.45
I've written about Urbino before, but because wife is providing me with such dazzling photographs of city, I feel compelled to do so again	3.3
As I noted in that post, Urbino is not built city so much as evolved one	3.14
built	3.0
evolved	3.27
The De Landa seems to have become unwitting theme of late	2.9
Of course it was built, but it was built vertically within city walls, meaning that new buildings were constructed atop existing ones like so: The effect is sort of architecture only finds in dreams or representations of them, like in finale of fourth season of Buffy Vampire Slayer, wherein Joss Whedon took advantage of contiguous film sets to depict Xander Harris moving seamlessly from upstairs bathroom at Buffy's house:	3.0
Because without leaving officially sanctioned lanes of transportation, pedestrians can venture into and through outdoor kitchens, university departments, central hallway of apartment buildings, and so on	3.12

I only mention that because in I visited city with wife and, as you probably guessed, real of this post was to indulge in bit of vicarious vacationing before returning to stack of ungraded papers that no amount of actual grading seems to have power to reduce	3.2
As evidence of how thoroughly corrupt region is, I present picture courtesy of her of cabin she will be staying in free of charge until July: That's view she will be writing her dissertation to next months	2.5
If it was not, even Homer nods?	3.0
No, but seriously, if that is not picture I actually took, it is exactly sort I relentlessly take, whereas check out wife's chops above: woman has eye	3.0

Re: your green culture talk, I think you are misappropriating Gore clip: is not he saying that your money would be better spent on political candidates and organizations that push for mandatory internalizing of externalities changing laws instead of on carbon offsets changing lightbulbs ?	3.0
My problem with carbon offsets and other voluntary measures is that given finite amount of money, energy and attention we have to push for environment, I feel like opportunity cost of these measures is too high compared to policyoriented actions, citizen role that Gore referred	2.75
For example, Earth Hour would be much more productive if it were global rally for carbon taxes; instead we depoliticize it and entertain idea that voluntarily turning off lights will stop climate change	2.6
I'm big fan of your work on IP and corruption, but I'm skeptical of these initial ventures into environmental arena	2.6
I am suspicious of cap trade It seems like complicated partial version of that, created by same genius quants who gave us mess on wall street, that is designed to generate large fees finance types My sense is for simpler system	2.7

But I want something more accurate	2.82
Jutta Kill, of Forests and European Union Resource Network FERN , was most vehement opponent of practice, arguing it probably did more harm than good	2.8
Carbon offsetting was unbelievably inefficient way of reducing emissions, she argued, and its effects were impossible to verify	2.5
In addition, More than half of money given to companies selling carbon offsets went on research and administration costs, benefiting not climate but burgeoning consultancy industry	2.8
So I was really happy to see on United page announcement of Carbon Offset Program	3.67

Carbon Offset Program	3.12
What I expected it to be was simple way to at least know what total carbon footprint from your flights for some period was after all, they have all data , and ideally, simple way to buy offsets	3.1
Additionally, there is reluctance to share data required for accurate emissions measurement due to perceived potential risks, possibly related to future regulatory concerns	2.8

Only those of Arrallin Insurrection inner team knew he was no common'beta furry'	2.9
His silken fur, which would be tawny golden and striped with jet black bands, was dyed perfectly to pure black, and his mane trimmed and thinned as to be indistinguishable from rest of his coat	3.2
Results, Harmon?	3.0
His eyes had been treated and darkened to rich purple to disguise brilliant golden yellow color that would marchk him as Alpha Arrallin, and leader of his hive	3.0

Harmon, tell that good for nothing son of beta to get his hindquarters through gate and back here NOW, or I'll open fire on him when we come back through	2.0
Readers of early versions of story might have been cheering for defeat of this demon disguised as beauty, and would have enjoyed reading stories for lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat	3.4
Conversely, authors of stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for death of Madame White Snake, so pleasure of narrative to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory comes not from death of insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching transgressions themselves	3.0
In essay on femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that strong behavior of female characters supersedes moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at end	2.89
She writes, final'lesson' of myth often fades into background and we retain image of erotic, strong, unrepressed if destructive woman	3.12

Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as villainous demon who drains life force out of her human husband	2.56
Janey Place, Women in Film Noir in Women in Film Noir, ed E Ann Kaplan London: British Film Institute, ,	3.0
Women in Film Noir	3.0
In these stories, femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in minds of readers not as shrunken snake trapped under pagoda, but sexy, aggressive woman who took weaker human man as her lover	3.0
This resistant reading of text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in past enjoyed about these stories	3.0
However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created female character who fits characteristics of feisty heroine	2.89
Just as dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as heroine in her own right, rather than sexy death trap for male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside bounds of conventional social expectations	3.2

Madame White Snake	3.0
The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, snake demon that takes human form and becomes wife of man, has exerted lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries	3.0
But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even model of ideal Confucian wife, particularly in Pagoda	3.0
Pagoda	3.0
Whalen Lai notes, She was loving wife, caring mother, rescuer of her family from first flood, and, at that point, general benefactor of man	3.4
She was loving wife, caring mother, rescuer of her family from first flood, and, at that point, general benefactor of man She took on virtues of traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance	3.46
Ibid,	2.9
But if she were really ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate?	3.0
Her dangerous sexuality is key	2.9
Femme fatale might seem unusual term to apply to character from premodern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify virtues of ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarchily associated with film characters, particularly those of film noir genre	3.1
Femme,	3.0
It refers to woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness	2.75
In both incarnations of Madame White snake, authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful	3.25
Toyoo, her human lover in Lust of White Serpant can not shake image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself disturbed and agitated by her ethereal beauty	3.29

quintessential novemberellas, The Lust of White Serpant from Ugetsu Monogatari by Japanese author Ueda Akinari and Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only evolution of White Snake figure to become more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal	3.0
In Eternal Prisoner, Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hs into his dreams, and next morning he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business	3.1

Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda Trans Diana Yu, in Y W Ma and Joseptemberh S M Lau Traditional Chinese Stories: Themes and Variations Boston: Zheng Zui Co, ,	3.1
Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is cause of their distraction	2.5
In addition to distracting sexuality, irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with archetypical noir femme fatale	3.0
In her essay analyzing noir film from feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes Not only is hero frequently not sure whether woman is honest or decembereiver, but heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to audience whether she fills femme fatale stereotype or not	3.0

Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda	2.64
She is loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with law and decembereives him about her supernatural nature	2.8
This is quite similar to expected end for femme fatal character in films she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored	2.8
In both stories, Madame White Snake's secret is uncovered and monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under pagoda	2.91
Her husband becomes monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from Buddhist perspective	3.0
Female beauty is dangerous thing that ties men to transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana	2.6
Furthermore, Lady White Snake's lover is far from ideal man	2.73
In Lust, priest informs Toyoo Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you	2.8
Lust,	3.4
The implications of this are that stronger, more capable man would not fall for Lady's trickery	2.9
If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as evil character	3.12
Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality	3.0
Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty: I searched everywhere, and now that at last I've found you, I'm very happy, Ibid, she gushes to him in Lust	3.7

Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her	2.5

In another traditional vernacular story, Tsu ShihNiang Sinks Jewel Box in Anger, Tu ShihNiang Sinks Jew Box in Anger, trans, Richard M W Ho, in Y W Ma and Joseptemberh S M Lau Traditional Chinese Stories: Themes and Variations Boston: Zheng Zui Co, , male protagonist breaks promise he made to his concubine lover, and suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on man's part as well as woman's	2.9

So her husband's failure to follow through on his end of bargain, completely forgetting love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake's plight	2.7
These stories draw from long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories, which usually end with demon destroyed or at least subdued	3.11
In initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under pagoda by Taoist monk or later, Buddhist monk Lai, would have been satisfying ending	3.0

I will help you find your Rachel	3.1
I have to warn you, though, you will not like what I have to tell you	2.0
Something in his tone could not be disbelieved	3.0
Tell me anyway	3.0
If she is in trouble, I want to find her, wherever she is	2.5
My driver took deep breath	3.0
As he did, his neck stretched in strange way and I noticed several thin lines, like wrinkles, running across sides of his neck	3.0
Nathan, he began in way that people speak when they start long and difficult explanation,	2.63
This person, like me, is not member of traditional society	3.0
You see, Nathan, there is septemberarate from your society oh, damn it	2.3
I've never had to give this conversation before	2.78
Come on, I have something to show you	3.1
With that, he made sharp turn onto side street that I had not noticed before	2.9
We drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decemberayed that I could not tell whether they were abandoned	2.33
My driver turned again next to old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to rave in sophomore year	3.0
In front of few houses, there were cars parked, but there were almost none on streets	2.9
Their bumpers looked ready to drop off, and their paint was half smog	2.78
I got strange feeling that we were not supposed to be driving here	2.43
Hey,	3.0
Hey, I said, are you sure that we should be going this way?	2.78
are you sure that we should be going this way?	2.7
I mean	3.1
Just ignore that,	2.8
You'll be used to sensation in moment	3.12
That just unnerved me more	2.0
My girlfriend Rachel and I would go to clubs near our school	3.25
I noticed that there were some people on street, people same color as soiled buildings	2.75
Someone standing just in lip of alley glared at me with gleaming eyes	2.64
he was already walking toward squat, brickwindowed building we were parked next to	3.0
Glancing back at that gleaming glare, I decemberided that it might be safer to follow driver than to wait with car	2.75
I hopped out, ran after him, and reached him just as he was knocking on door	3.0
Someone opened it crack, then ushered us in	2.8
Sometimes we would get word that people were gathering under of bridges, and we would rush down to hit it before cops broke it up	3.2
The ceiling was high and wooden, and I could see part of DJ's booth down hall	3.2
It looked like we were in back of nightclub	3.0
Then I looked down and saw what had let us in	3.0
What up?	3.11
The hunchbacked being who let us in held out scraggly paw for him to slap	2.75
Nice, my man,	3.9
Nice, my man, he said as they clasped hands	3.73
Who's freak?	2.22
This is someone from Ivan's family	3.11
Did I ever tell you about them?	3.0
Yeah, time, man, but you were pretty fucked up	2.4
What's your problem, kid?	2.4
The hunchbacked man came up to my stomach	2.8
It pulled back around his fingertips, which bore things that might have been nails or claws	2.62
When he grinned, I saw that his teeth were sharp and small, like hunting cat's	2.86
Nepthys quickly answered for me	3.0
Girlfriend troubles	2.3
Bummer	1.9
So, what is cat look like?	3.3
He turned to me	3.0
Nepthys nodded: It's okay, you can trust him	3.1
It's okay, you can trust him	3.2
That's why we came here	3.2
It was easier to talk than to question	2.9
I I noticed him from across room when I was looking around for Rachel	2.9
Boston is strange place at night	2.7
He was standing right in front of some blue lights, so I could not see him very well, but I noticed way that light set off his pale skin	3.2
He was slim, almost drawn, but he had kind of luster to him, I guess	3.1
You would not believe half of shit I've seen, even when I was straight	2.7
They nodded	3.0
Oh, totally,	3.12
Oh, totally, said hunchback	2.9
I get that all time around here	3.1
He was wearing sort of jacket maybe blue velvet, I could not tell in dark, but it had ruffles at throat, things like that	3.0
That's why I could not understand why else remembered him	2.8
He had some rings, too	3.0
I do not know how he could have been heard over music	2.8
What do you think?	3.0
asked hunchback	3.0
I've looked into it little, and I do think we might be dealing with of them	2.6
Have you seen anyone like that in your club?	3.0
Not that I can remember, man	3.0
I can send you to guy who knows all about them, though	3.0
It was Friday night	3.0
If this cat's for real, I bet my friend can tell you everything you need to know	3.1
It will not be long before nightfall	2.8
Oh yeah, man	3.57
Rachel and I went out to dinner, and when we finished, she saw that there was message on her cell phone	3.0
Here, let me write down how to find him	3.0
Here you go, man	3.0
Good luck!	4.09
Thanks, Dvorov	3.56
I owe you one	3.6
That last was to me	2.8
I waved goodbye to hunchback as we left	3.11
He gave me halfhearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing, and whether I should be wearing body armor	2.9
Back on street, I began to see things that I had never looked for until then	3.2
Still in my initial shock, I suddenly noticed qualities of people that my mind had not registered when we parked	2.6
I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that corners had broken through people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them, and people whose skin was gathered back like ponytail	2.6
I saw men feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light	2.67
A corpulent, batrachian woman walked along with something on leash that looked like massive water beetle	2.75
She checked it there in restaurant	3.0
thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed	3.0
I noticed when my back hit wall that I was walking backwards	2.78
We, and thousands like us, have been living septemberarately as long as there has been human society, said my driver	3.0
Her head tilted into phone as she listened, her pleather purse on her lap, shining jet against worn black of her snug Dead Can Dance Tshirt	3.0
I noticed that wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills	2.9
At this point, we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional	2.8
The only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on fringes of yours	3.0
Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this, where human population is so overwhelming that they will not be noticed in right corner, with right protective spells	2.7
He took out hunchback's directions and glanced at alley behind us	2.88
Okay, Nathan	3.0
We should get started right away	3.11
There's no time to waste	3.0
He saw that I was not moving	2.66
Setting arm on my shoulder, he said, Nathan, what you see here might be frightening, but those things you saw are people just like you	3.0
They'll be as surprised to see human as you are to see men with arms	3.1
Thanks	3.43
It's very reassuring that I'll not only be outsider but curiosity	3.2
Well, she is here and she needs your help	3.1
But why are you even helping me?	2.88
Until seconds ago, I did not believe in magic or any of that kind of weirdness	3.2
In this world, one's word is promise	3.14
Now, can we get going?	2.5
Only if you stop beginning every sentence with my name	2.75
You've got deal	3.57
Let's go	3.1
As we headed down sidewalk, I said, What is your name, anyway?	3.1
That's question you learn not to ask here	2.8
Holding Dvorov's directions, Nepthys took us around corner of building into skinny alleyway	3.0
I started wondering again how reliable my guide's credentials were	2.4
Walking through alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from wall to other, he did not inspire confidence	2.2
Just at this corner,	3.0
we are going to stop and turn times widdersh er, counterclockwise, then face east	2.8
East is that way	3.0
He pointed at wall to our right	3.0
Do n't let sun fool you	2.8
Then I'm going to shed little blood, but do not worry, none of yours	3.0
I blinked at him, but he just kept walking until we reached corner	2.9
Okay, you might feel silly, but just turn times to your left	3.0
Try to keep in time with me	2.89
We spun around times, and then something flashed across Nepthys' hand and he shook spray of blood onto dust	2.6
I do not know it was going to be just us tonight	2.6
The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit ground, and I jumped back	2.6
Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening door	2.78
Are you coming?	3.0
We slipped through door and came out, not inside building, but on busy street in completely different part of town	3.0
The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere way I'd picture marchket in Middle East	3.0
I'm not sure I'm up for night out	2.5
Nepthys took us immediately to right, where he led us to cart filled with herbs	3.0
Spiced air hanging around cart carried tarragon, rosemarchy, and scents I could not place	3.1
I was feeling calm and private that night	3.1
Its face was small and wrinkled, with pennysized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose	3.0
Would gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs?	3.2
it asked	3.0
There are no finer to spice meal, nor purer to mix potion	3.11
It seemed like tonight's darkness was small and personal, cupped hands offering place for two, not burning, open darkness of rave	2.67
We're not here to browse,	2.89
We're not here to browse, Nepthys told him	2.67
We'd like to see man about some garlic	3.0
The thing frowned	2.18
We have many fine cloves of garlic here on cart, gentle sir	3.4
If	2.9
You know what I mean	3.14
I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons	3.1
It hissed thoughtfully	2.8
True, true	3.1
Step behind cart and enter through door there, using your left hand to open door and your right	3.0
to close it	2.9
Thank you	3.9
Nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind cart	3.14
The latch opened under Nepthys' left hand with clack!	3.0
The door took us to bottom of flight of wooden stairs	2.9
We entered	3.0
The room held bed, bookcase, and desk with chair	2.86
Its only light came from dying candle on desk whose spark etched shadows in roughly planked walls	3.0
On bed was small, ratty man	2.7
I smelled matted hair and cedar chips	2.9
We're here for information about vampire,	3.1
We're here for information about vampire, said Nepthys	3.0
Oh, shit!	1.9
Sorry, kid	2.4
Would you do us kindness of helping us to identify individual?	3.0
Wait, Nepthys you said nothing about vampires	2.8
Frankly, I do not know if we can even doing anything against vampire	2.71
Are look, are they as bad as people in my world think they are?	2.5
I do not know	2.56
Only unsuccessfully, right?	2.44
No, those people do not usually leave stories	2.87
Oh, thanks, Nepthys, for your confidenceinspiring tales of experience	3.7
So they are probably worse than we think, okay, that is great	2.88
Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into Anne Rice novemberel?	2.9
Let's go together, you know you will have fun once you get into it	3.56
My plan is that you shut up while we are trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what we are actually going up against	2.4
Do n't forget, she is your girlfriend	3.0
It came in through my mother's blood; my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories, bylichkas, of ancestors with second sight , stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting special fish off their hooks, and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times	2.91
Now calm down while I talk to this gentleman	2.9
I can hear your heartbeat from over here	3.37
I shut up and tried to breathe	2.29
Nepthys turned back to little man on bed, who had not moved	3.0
Please, accept our apologies	2.4
As you can see, our situation is of personal importance to young man	3.09
Now: may we ask you few questions about individual we believe to be vampire?	2.55
It would be great help to us	3.44
She bit inside of her bottom lip, looking at me like I was breaking her poor, sweet heart	2.0
My information is purely for purposes of collector	3.25
I do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm	2.88
Sir, we simply want to discover whether this individual is, in fact, vampire	2.8
If there is any boon that you would have us do in return, we would be glad to do it	3.54
He continued to lie in place, still breathing heavily	2.7
I tried to keep myself calm	2.8
I have need of certain stone that I once possessed	3.0
My problem is that it was not made in this realm, but by human, and only human may handle it	2.6
If you would fetch me this stone, I would tell you what I can	3.0
Of course we will fetch you stone,	3.12
Of course we will fetch you stone, Nepthys assured him	3.0
You have our thanks	3.7
When we reached street, I expected some sort of temple, or row of antiquaries, or at least sleazy, blackmarchket relics merchant	2.8
Instead, it looked like we were in redlight district: women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from alleys	2.91
Nepthys did not need to warn me not to speak to them	2.7
Okay, Rachel	3.22
He took us to door of building like short pagoda that had sign hanging over it showing face with hands uplifted, like saint under G d's light, and handcuffed	3.0
Let's go, you are probably right	3.0
Inside, entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions	3.1
Sails of obscene orange and green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive	2.6
A large woman, similarly decemberorated, quickly drifted up to us	3.1
Good evening, gentlemen,	3.5
May I invite you to have cup of tea?	3.11
She grinned and gave me kiss across table, her lips soft and firm and sticking just enough that she gave feeling you were really kissing, not just pressing your face into someone else's	3.7
No, thank you, said Nepthys, we regret that we can not take up your kind offer	2.5
Are you proprietor of this shop?	3.0
I am Madame Entera, at your service	3.29
She raised eyebrow	2.9
Are you?	3.1
Well, we do not get many customers asking about that item	2.78
Please, walk this way	3.0
She led us past silks and through arch decemberorated with pictures of wooden ships and what looked like African tribesmen	3.0
The next room had mosaics of what could have been Rome, with men in simple tunics working in vineyard on wall and men in odd, floppy hats on other	3.25
After this, we went up flight of stairs and past row of doors barred on outside	3.0
Excuse me,	2.9
but may I ask what is kept in these rooms?	3.0
Why, merchandise, of course,	3.2
Nepthys leaned close to my ear	3.14
This is slave shop,	2.37
This is slave shop, he explained quietly	2.12
The woman paused before another door, this not barred but locked	3.0
As she brought out key, she said, We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items	3.0
We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items	3.0
We've had genies, indentured sorcerers, even golems and occasional elf	3.22
This is of stranger items, though	3.0
It's been in our collection for several years because only human can activate it	3.0
If we only had human on our staff, we could have done so ages ago and sold it off, but we have no such luck	2.57
She opened door and took us past several doors marchked with odd geometrical designs to another locked room	3.0
Here it is,	3.09
Here it is, she said	3.0
With flourish, she opened door to reveal room with walls inlaid with lapis and gold wire, intricate patterns like Czar's jewelry box crawling down walls	3.0
Let's not get fucked up tonight, though, okay, Rache?	2.83
A marchvel, is not it?	3.5
she said	3.0
That such rock could hold so much magic it is wonder	3.67
That it is,	3.0
That it is, Nepthys assured her	3.0
What would convince you to part with it?	3.0
No,	2.5
No,	2.29
she said, seeing his expression, that would make stone rather useless	2.9
appraising glance	3.3
I have never felt so appraised in all my life	3.86
He looks healthy,	3.6
He looks healthy, she said, how about pint of his blood?	3.0
how about pint of his blood?	2.75
Madame, I have his health to consider	2.88
Half pint, then and his hair	2.9
Remember, this is your quest	3.0
I'm not giving my blood	2.2
Sure, babe	3.14
As if I wanted it,	2.6
As if I wanted it, interrupted woman	2.44
I think it is fair deal, considering return,	3.2
I think it is fair deal, considering return, he told me, but it is up to you	3.3
but it is up to you	3.0
I thought about it, then nodded	3.09
Marvelous! cried woman	4.0
halfpint of human blood, willingly given, and his fine head of hair for stone	2.7
She took us downstairs to small room behind red silk draping	3.0
There was wooden chair, where she sat me down and asked me to wait	3.0
Roll up your sleeves,	3.0
She opened bowl and carefully, gingerly brought out fat, dripping leech	3.1
It must have been larger than my finger	3.0
She laid it gently inside hollow of my left arm	3.2
The cold thing stretched and cast around with its suckermouth until it found soft spot inside my elbow, where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin	2.73
Let's not waste any more time	2.63
I thought that I could feel slight itching	2.5
They take about quarterpint each,	2.9
They're quick, too	3.14
Then she clapped her hands and brought in barber	3.3
She stood up and I followed her out to street	3.1
At least barber had not nicked me	3.3
Be careful you do not let him touch it until you are ready to use it,	2.9
Be careful you do not let him touch it until you are ready to use it, woman admonished Nepthys as she slipped stone into grey cloth pouch and handed it to him	2.88
Thank you for doing business at our house, and I hope to see you again!	3.9
It was dark enough that I could actually see few stars through screen of city light	3.2
Come on,	2.8
Come on, said Nepthys, you could use drink	3.18
you could use drink	3.0
We hit bar on next street over	3.12
Vodka, straight up,	3.1
Vodka, straight up, Nepthys told bartender as we sat down at counter, and Bloody Mary for my friend	3.0
and Bloody Mary for my friend	3.1
Make it extra bloody	3.0
That should help,	3.4
That should help, he said	3.1
You could run on empty with little of that stuff	3.1
He grinned at me	3.9
Drink up, kid	3.12
Nepthys slapped me on back	2.6
Okay,	2.88
I mean, what is this place, really?	2.7
He thought about that	3.0
I think that our world is reflection of yours, or yours is more boring reflection of ours	2.62
Without hearing car horns, I could almost taste air of late March through street fumes	3.1
In America, things are still weird after European conquest	2.9
The natives are still here, but so is everyone else	2.88
What do you mean?	3.0
Okay, take elves	3.0
He caugustht bartender's eye for another shot	3.1
Not in America	2.62
Here, they are snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like'gritty ambience' you have them in your world, too, right?	2.7
There's amazing DJ who is elf	3.75
He has real ear for it	2.91
He downed second shot	3.0
I am glad to be out of favortrading scene for half minute	3.7
It's exhausting to talk to those people	2.78
wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something	2.5
So what else do you want to know, Nathan?	3.0
I mean, where do dryads fit in place like this?	2.89
If tree is not around, dryad is not around	2.6
It's as simple as that	3.14
That made me little sad	1.89
They were always my favorite part of Greek myths I read in elementary school	3.3
Well, what about you?	3.0
My parents came over from Russia, just like your family	3.11
It was last February, after winter break, that we moved in together	3.1
My real name is little more ethnically appropriate, but we do not toss those around in this place	2.62
They were spirits of certain branch of Volga and village based around mill on that tributary	3.0
When Russian government dammed river, my parents decemberided that instead of dying with river, they would stick with people of village they would protected	2.9
I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river	3.3
He took another shot of vodka	2.91
I mean, we might have lot of work ahead of us	3.0
Are you kidding?	2.4
I can drink like fish, kid	3.2
We should get going, though	3.0
Still woozy?	2.62
I nodded	3.0
A little walking should get stuff into your system	3.1
As we left bar, I asked to see rock	3.0
Why?	2.38
Nepthys asked	3.0
I'm just curious	3.11
I want to see what magic stone looks like	3.0
Do n't worry, I'll be careful not to touch it	2.75
He thought about it, then handed me pouch	3.0
It looked like normal river stone, gray oval with white stripe through it	3.1
I almost tripped over him, and stone went flying out of pouch	2.8
Nepthys tried to grab it, but, by reflex, I caugustht it first	3.0
Is n't it amazing night, Rache?	3.6
Immediately, I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid	2.1
Nathan, said Nepthys, I think that you just did something very stupid	2.71
I agree,	3.56
The stone was as warm as human flesh now, and there was sort of glow that might have been light or just stone's soft heat, I do not know	3.2
Even city feels alive when spring comes	3.8
Then there was light, kind of rosy glow, and I felt stone slip out of my hand to float in air	3.4
I shouted, hardly able to hear myself	2.6
Nepthys was saying something that looked like, I have no idea!	3.0
I have no idea!	2.5
but I could not hear him	2.5
The light in corners of my eyes rushed in, converging on rosy glow around stone, and for moment I was blind	2.7
Taxi!	3.09
There was no sign of stone	2.6
I think I understand why we got that stone from slave shop, said Nepthys	2.9
She waved down car and pulled me in	3.09
The girl was as soft and rosy as stone's glow, and she was dressed in white shift tied at waist with belt like Celtic knot	3.5
Her arms and legs were wrapped in white linen up to her wrists and ankles, and soft, white leather boots held her feet	3.1
In few minutes, we were getting out block down from abandoned church	3.0
As soon as I touched her, her eyes opened into mine and she grabbed my wrist	3.1
I could not move	2.1
Name me,	3.1
Name me, she said	3.0
What did you say?'	3.0
I was at loss	2.0
I'd never named anyone before	2.9
I thought back to time when I'd been thinking about raising family and remembered that I'd always liked name	3.3
Amy	2.91
You awaken magical being of unknown power from enchanted stone, having purchased her with your own blood from slave dealer, and you name her'Amy'?	3.11
After she paid driver, she grabbed my arm, laugusthing, and we ran down street	3.88
So back to our garlicky friend?	3.29
I suppose so, said Nepthys, and you would better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he will not care we woke her up	2.75
and you would better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he will not care we woke her up	2.3
We walked back to herb stand	3.12
The vendor stared little at Amy, his arms pausing in midair as he lit stand's little lamp, but we walked right around him and up wooden stairs	2.7
When Nepthys opened little man's door, he rolled over and grinned to see us, but when Amy walked in, he blanched	2.57
What!	3.1
he screamed	2.22
You idiots!	2.22
You woke it up?	2.75
But but sir,	2.7
But but sir, I said, are you sure she is no help to you?	3.0
are you sure she is no help to you?	3.0
Not if you named it already, you ninny, and I'm sure that you have!	2.25
I heard pulse already	3.1
Fools!	2.25
Get out of my sight now unless you know how to put it back?	2.12
Now leave, before I call rats on you	2.4
You idiot,	1.88
I should say, set yourself back, since it is your girlfriend we are looking for	3.0
You're just lucky that Dvorov is not my only contact	2.88
Come on, we are heading out	3.0
ome on, we are heading out	3.1
He held door for me and Amy when we reached bottom of stairs	3.4
Walking outside, I was shocked to see that it was already dark	2.9
Night comes quickly here,	2.9
Night comes quickly here, said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me	2.88
Did n't I warn you?	2.44
Okay,	3.0
First, though, we are getting you hat	3.1
You look ridiculous with shaved head	2.4
At nearby stand, he grabbed first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston	3.14
It was black baseball cap that read Dead Can Dance in gold across front	2.89
Dead Can Dance	2.89
Amy liked it, I think	3.0
She still had not spoken since I named her, so I was not sure	3.11
He took us to squat, long building whose roof bulged up like ribs of gutted animal	3.0
The black door opened as we came up to it, and pale man opened door	3.0
I only say he because he did not have hint of femininity	2.82
he	3.0
His eyes were white	2.82
From behind him, I could hear something that sounded like remix of Cure's A Forest	3.29
A Forest	3.0
I'm here to see Isis	3.0
Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her	3.0
A moment later, he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in	3.2
Nepthys walked straight past him and I tried to keep up, taking Amy's small hand so that she would not lag behind	2.9
Amy gave my hand squeeze	3.4
Nepthys lead us down hallway that matched building's faade, vaulted, ribbed intestine of hallway, whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic	3.0
We kissed and slipped inside	3.9
Then there was door, which opened as we approached	3.0
Inside, space opened into wide, square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size	3.0
The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on altar, just DJ's toolkit and his beer	2.3
These were incontestably male	3.0
Nepthys!	3.0
said woman, slithering up across furs to sit up	3.14
As she rose, her robes fell open and I realized that, except for what looked like red silk kimono, she was naked naked and stunning	3.55
I had urge to cover Amy's eyes	2.89
It's been years since I've seen you	3.64
Please, come and sit beside me, and introduce your friends	3.29
This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in human world,	2.9
This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in human world, said Nepthys, ushering us toward woman in silk	3.0
The girl is surprising,	3.4
The girl is surprising, he concluded	3.4
And I am Isis,	2.7
And I am Isis, said woman, offering her hand to me	3.0
I took it and, dropping to knee, gave her fingers small kiss	3.5
It seemed appropriate	3.11
It is honor to meet you, Lady Isis, I said	3.9
She laugusthed, liquid, alluring, alarming	3.8
He has lovely manners, Nepthys, despite his poor taste in hats	3.4
You may leave out'Lady,' boy	3.0
Through dark, I could see bolts left in wall from where they would taken down crucifix	2.9
Now, how can I help elegantly mannered friend of my Nepthys and his surprising young charge?	3.3
I hope I can start by offering some wine	3.3
Nepthys poured out wine for of us	3.25
May I have little more of what you gave me before, Nepthys?	3.0
I asked	3.1
I still feel little woozy	2.3
The wine's rich scent had touch of something chemical that I recognized from bar, but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth	3.37
Isis' nostrils twitched slightly	2.88
Does it have anything to do with why your head is shaved?	3.0
It was part of price for this girl, who was rock at time,	3.0
It was part of price for this girl, who was rock at time, explained Nepthys	3.11
I have feeling that she was worth trade,	3.29
I have feeling that she was worth trade, I added	3.29
Amy, still holding my hand, smiled	4.1
She may be at that,	3.0
She may be at that, said Isis, gazing at her	3.0
A confessional too beatenup to have been sold was shaking in way that suggested activity inside, and where pews had been taken out, couple people were testifying to DJ's moving sermon	3.25
She has good blood under her cheeks	3.22
Amy did not blush, and I hoped that she did not understand what Isis was saying	2.86
She would have been worth it,	3.2
She would have been worth it, Nepthys interrupted, if this fool had not accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact	2.7
if this fool had not accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact	2.3
He was going to give us valuable information for her	3.2
Now I understand why you are here,	3.12
Now I understand why you are here, said Isis	3.2
So what do you need to know?	3.0
You know I would not come to you if I could get this information another way,	2.9
You know I would not come to you if I could get this information another way, said Nepthys apologetically	2.8
I think that person who stole girl we are looking for might be vampire	2.7
If I know him, I can find him	3.0
If not, you will have to bring me something to work with	2.78
Nepthys looked at me	3.12
I thought back to seeing man in hollow church and described his skin, his dark hair, way that light seemed to flow around him, as best as I could	3.0
Isis set her elbows in fur and rested her head on her hands while I spoke and tried not to stare at her full, hanging breasts	3.1
When I had told her all that I could remember, she blinked her black lashes and said, I remember him	3.1
Nepthys could hardly believe her	2.71
It is	3.0
He should be	3.11
I hope that you can do better job than last lot	2.6
She sat up, running her hands along her pale, round thighs	3.2
All right, then	3.0
Let me see if I can find him	3.0
Isis closed her eyes and lifted her hands	3.0
A dark glow coalesced around her palms	2.9
Amy leaned forward, looking amazed	3.55
The glow reflected on her pink face, casting sickly pallor over her heartbeatstrong cheeks	2.38
Tiny drops of blood began to seep out of Isis' palms as her brow creased	2.4
Her candy lips twisted into frown	2.44
The dark glow grew stronger and larger, filling air for about foot around her hands	2.75
In her palms, droplets of blood swelled into small pools	2.5
The dark glow began to flicker, and Isis' frown of concentration became of worry	2.8
She did not shed bead of sweat, and I did not even see her draw breath, but glow around her hands shuddered like stubborn candleflame	2.9
Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake	2.8
The blood in her palms, still filling up, began to ripple	2.88
He glanced at me with honest concern, probably first honest moment he would shown me:'Is she all right?'	3.11
Is she all right?'	2.7
She gasped and dark glow went out, taking blood with it in flash of heat and red steam	2.8
Isis collapsed on fur, strings cut	2.6
She shook her head, rubbing her face into white fur and murmuring something	2.9
She rolled onto her back, her arms crossed tightly over her chest	2.9
For first time, she looked vulnerable	2.7
I found your vampire, she said, but he might know that someone's looking for him	2.7
He's taken great pains to keep himself hidden	2.6
You should look for him at Dvorov's as quickly as you can	3.0
She turned to me with tired sympathy	2.9
I did not see girl with him	2.8
Hurry, though, and you might find him before he leaves	2.9
A twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants	3.14
I looked back to see Nepthys whispering something to her	3.1
He stood to go, but she caugustht his sleeve and pulled him back for moment	3.0
There was terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of next, and old stainedglass windows rattled in their frames	2.7
I turned back to door	3.0
Come on, Amy, I said, he will be along soon	3.2
When we got there, another pale servant was waiting for us with box of dark stained wood	2.89
He offered it to Nepthys, who opened box: on velvet lining, wooden hammer and stakes	2.9
Mountain ash,	3.0
I really hope we find your Rachel, he said	3.25
I know quick way to Dvorov's,	3.4
I know quick way to Dvorov's, said Nepthys	3.0
I bet he is kicking himself now for not having way to contact me	2.86
The pulse from inside made building sound like giant heart	3.0
Yo, my man Nep!	3.8
No, but we got tip that he might be in your club	3.0
Have you seen him?	3.0
Here, man?	3.1
I have not had vampire here since you and Nepthys shot wicked look at him	2.8
Anyway, long time, man	2.9
That's odd	2.5
On dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in air	3.5
Do you mind if we check it out anyway?	3.0
I have real feeling that he is in here somewhere	3.0
Dvorov glanced over his shoulder, little nervous	2.44
We'll be in and out in minute	3.0
Nepthys stepped in and Dvorov walked us towards dance floor	3.1
Dvorov asked us	3.0
No, he said that his research was purely academic, not for hunters	3.0
Bummer	2.11
I guess I probably should have known, though	2.25
I mean, he is kinda tight about that stuff	2.9
He did not look very surprised	2.4
Anyway, this is dance floor, man	3.1
Good luck	3.6
Then I saw bar on other side of crowd and knew where to start looking	3.1
I danced with Rachel for while, but then something by bar seemed to be pulling her eyes	2.9
I tried to slip along edge of crowd	2.88
Things with scales and claws kept flailing against me, pressing me into wall, but I took breath and kept moving	2.5
My nose filled with reek of thick sweat	2.38
The music began to build, and strobe came on	3.25
Somewhere toward center of dance floor, I heard howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing for second, I was back with my family in Russia, hiding from cold	2.6
Then I felt tug on back of my shirt and noticed that Amy was following me	3.17
I gathered her under my arm	3.1
Dvorov was somewhere behind me, too, negotiating delicately through his patrons	3.1
It slumped to floor and I realized that it was werewolf	2.63
Its haunches twitched in time to music	3.2
As it started to rise, man with thick, scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him	2.88
She told me that she was heading for drink and slipped out of crowd	3.0
I thought that my odds were better on dance floor	3.2
Holding Amy in my arms as we ducked between crush of dancers, I started to wonder if chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this	3.0
A cold thing with countless, writhing tentacles fell against me, thrashing as if in throes of drug overdose, tripping me and clutching at my limbs	2.73
A woman who could have been elf twitched and jerked beside me, fingers trembling at torn edges of her clothing	3.0
The creature blocking my vision moved back, but I had seen all that I needed to see	3.12
A bleeding, eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me, but I ducked around it and toward bar	2.7
When she had not come back halfway through next song, I glanced over at bar	3.0
I slipped past waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before, mountain of wet, veined flesh, and had almost passed through crowd when clawed hand grabbed my arm	2.3
He pulled my ear down to his mouth	2.8
You seen enough, man?	2.7
he shouted	2.4
Yes,	3.5
Yes, I called back, I saw him!	3.4
I saw him!	3.0
He's sitting right there at bar!	3.0
Dvorov tried to peek through crowd, but it had shifted again and we could not see thing	2.6
I do not think he is there,	2.8
No, I saw him!	2.7
I have to hurry, too!	2.62
Who knows how long he will stick around?	3.0
Listen, man, he is not there!	2.7
I'm telling you, it is not even worth checking bar!	2.3
Do n't do this, kid!	2.36
It was just little setup where someone had stacked few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer	3.1
It's dumb idea	2.38
Even if you did find this vampire cat, he would tear you apart!	2.7
Suddenly, Amy screamed	2.0
I whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock Dvorov away	2.71
His eyes were glowing red, and he had bared set of fangs that could probably take my hand off	2.5
The dancers near us tried to clear some space	2.9
He shot back up, hardly touching ground, and I kicked him back	2.75
He jumped at my arm while I was still offbalance, and I felt surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that it is too late to save itself	2.9
Nepthys stood over him with blue sword in his hand	2.8
He was not only with secret or two,	3.1
He was not only with secret or two, he said by way of explanation	2.8
You spotted our boy, did not you?	3.2
I bet his hideout is nearby, too	3.0
Rachel was standing with plastic cup, looking like she was having conversation, but I could not see anyone else there	2.9
Let's hurry	3.1
He wiped off sword and sheathed it in scabbard now belted to his hip	3.0
The crowd parted for us	3.2
The vampire glanced up when he saw crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us	2.8
In blink of strobe light, he was on his feet and dashing from room	3.2
Come on!	2.75
shouted Nepthys	3.2
We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us	2.8
He bashed up set of stairs set into side of wall, and we chased up after him, heading up huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than building could have held	2.62
Luckily, vampire turned off after stories	3.1
He ran down hallway and slipped behind of doors, but Nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me	3.0
I called out to Amy to shut door in case vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us	2.75
Inside was dark room that looked like storage space for DJ equipment	3.0
Nepthys urged me on from back of room, then made turn out of sight	3.1
When I came to door at end of room, it looked like it had been torn off its hinges	2.6
I did not imagine that Nepthys had done it, and it was not without alarm that I ran after him	2.44
The vault rose into obscurity above me, and massive rose window stood ahead of me	3.0
The panes looked dyed black, and only few cold beams slipped through filter	2.82
When I asked her if she would ever seen them before I was old enough to stop believing, I mean she would always look sad and tell me, No, not since family came to America has anything happened to us	2.71
On steps in front of altar, I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and other women	2.9
He stood in front of blue light, so I could not see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable	3.2
Then I heard Nepthys shout, Nathan!	2.9
Nathan!	3.27
Behind you!	2.8
I whirled and dropped in time to see vampire shoot over my head, leaping like panther	2.8
There was Nepthys, on other side of pews, holding wooden box in his hand	3.22
He tossed it to me, and I just barely had it open before I saw vampire again, turning to face me	2.8
I pulled out hammer and of stakes	3.22
He leapt over pews, soaring like grasshopper, and drew gleaming knife in midair	2.75
I dodged, but he tossed it, and I held box in front of my face	2.8
The blade lodged in wood, its silver penetrating velvet and nearly reaching my skin	2.62
My arms shook from force of his throw	2.4
Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand	2.6
His first move pulled out dagger, almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to box, and second shattered box with crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards	2.5
He wore jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin	3.4
I dropped splinters and broken second stake and raised my hammer, ready to drive ash spike into his heart	2.75
Behind him, I saw Nepthys running between pews	3.0
I braced my legs against stone floor and he was on me	3.0
I raised stake; he drew back dagger for slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine	2.3
The stake went down, there was blur, and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw	2.11
points of fire opened in my throat for instant, then all went numb	2.4
My mind began to dissipate, but then I felt pain withdraw and lifeless voice said, This one's blood is not worth drinking	2.71
This one's blood is not worth drinking	2.6
Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack	1.9
I must have fallen to floor then	2.3
I could perceive Nepthys' sword flashing over me, and I heard steel crack, then bone	2.38
The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in darkness	2.9
I thought I heard Rachel's voice blearily calling for me	2.75
Then set of footsteps began walking toward altar	2.9
I was content to let myself drift away, and I had almost forgotten body lying with broken neck on cathedral's hard tiles when I felt warm touch on its cheek	2.7
A girl's voice, soft and almost recognizable, spoke, Nathan	3.1
Nathan	3.0
I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected	3.2
Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me hammer and stake	3.0
I stood and turned toward altar	3.0
The vampire was walking just steps ahead of me	2.56
I stepped up behind him and raised my hands, which almost seemed to be glowing	3.3
Then stake came down into his back and one, two, strikes with hammer drove it in	2.3
The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth	2.38
Behind me, Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys, whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at slight tug	3.0
Rachel, her clothes torn and her face drawn, looked like she might cry when she saw me	2.33
I pulled her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me	3.7
My fuckin' hero,	3.5
My fuckin' hero, she whispered	3.8
The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving	3.0
She nodded and he took her arm	3.1
I watched them through crush of dancers as they squeezed along wall, and feeling came to me that something was very wrong	2.4
Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still had not come home	2.5
I called Mitch and our other friends, hoping that she would crashed at of their houses, but I had no luck	2.4
A couple of them remembered seeing her leave, but none of them had seen thin man with her	3.0
Nathan's Bylichka	3.0
I did not know how they could miss such exotic features, even in that distorting light	2.78
I caugustht taxi back to church	3.0
It was still mess, but everything bigger than soda can had disappeared	2.6
The church was completely different now: sunlight fell through stained glass, catching dust that still hung in air and sending dry, healthy warmth into edges of room, through stone and powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights	3.1
Standing in center of church, I took out my cell phone and called police	2.8
I need to file missing persons report	2.3
Rachel Frieze	2.82
Last night, walking on West nd street around maybe or of clock	3.0
But, sir, this is unusual situation	2.7
But if you ever should see faerie, tell him that you are of blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly	3.1
My girlfriend has disappeared, I do not even know where to start looking, and I need help!	1.57
I understand	3.0
The police would not file report for someone who'd been missing overnight	2.7
Walking out of church, little gust of cold air caugustht me by surprise	2.9
A cold front must have hit while I was inside	2.82
Glancing down street, I realized that I did not have friend to drive me home this time, and it was long walk back to streets where taxis ran	2.5
I pulled my Tshirt's sleeves down my arms as far as they would go, but I was not ready for cold	2.9
Walking did not build up much heat; it just moved air enough to chill me more	2.75
After I'd walked about block, car rolled up behind me	2.63
Hey, said male voice, do you need some help?	3.0
I turned around	3.0
The man looked over forty, and he was driving car I'd be afraid to drive on this street	2.5
It's long way to anywhere worth going,	2.91
he said	3.0
Would you like some help?	3.2
Ah, I think I'm fine, thanks,	3.44
Ah, I think I'm fine, thanks, I told him, and turned back to sidewalk	3.38
As I got older, I shook tales off with nod and Yes, Nana	3.0
Really, I'd like to help	3.4
Please, hop in	3.2
You do not look dressed for this weather	2.7
I glanced back over my shoulder	2.8
No thanks, sir!	2.63
I'm just fine	3.4
Really, do not worry about me	2.8
Nathan Spencer, I offer you help	3.2
I advise that you not refuse me third time	2.1
I stopped and looked back at him, surprised	3.0
He met my eyes coolly	2.9
How do you know my name?	2.8
I know your family	3.0
Get in	2.9
We have lot of work ahead of us, and it is best to start now	2.9
Yes, Nana	3.1
I walked around car and got into passenger seat	3.0
Before I had my belt on, we were rolling forward	2.8
Okay,	3.09
I'm in car	3.0
I got older and went to school, then to college, and I replaced dreams my Nana gave me with music DJs mixed for crowds in clubs, webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything	2.91
In fact, why did not you call me by name first time?	2.7
And how did you recognize me when	3.1
I know your family because ancestor of mine made bargain with ancestor of yours	3.2
I am here now because you called for help, and else would answer	2.9
He turned onto next street and shifted up	3.0

In Ochoa, , Angels get experienced majorleague outfielder who is hitting with homers and RBI this season	3.2
Ochoa has played in majors for different teams starting in	3.0
His best season came in with Reds, when he hit with homers and RBI	3.43
ANGELS MAKE TRADE TO GET OUTFIELD DEPTH	2.9
He gives you lot in all areas,	3.5
He gives you lot in all areas, Angels general manager Bill Stoneman said	3.27
He's righthanded bat, which complements Palmeiro off bench	3.2
From realistic standpoint, were we going to find outfielder that pushed of our outfielders to bench?	2.9
The answer is no	2.7
He accepts his role with club and he is team guy	3.4
He's got that reputation and that is important to us, especially club like ours that is egoless club	3.3
Ochoa will join club today in Anaheim before tonight's game against Yankees	3.1
He said he is fine with his role as reserve outfielder and pinch hitter	3.2
I've done that lot in my career,	3.4
I've done that lot in my career, Ochoa said during conference call	3.12
Coming in, they have got great outfielders I knew that from getgo	3.44
Ochoa's new teammates were generally pleased with move, even if it was not blockbuster	3.5
It's not big, earthshattering stuff,	2.9
It's not big, earthshattering stuff, right fielder Tim Salmon said	3.0
But we did not need something earthshattering right now	2.5
It did not seem like we had lot of holes to fill	3.12
It's good, it gives us something we did not have and we did not lose much	3.5
It's because of Molina: The Angels felt they could part with Fabregas because of play of catcher Jose Molina	3.1
ANAHEIM, Calif The Anaheim Angels got help where they felt they needed it most, agreeing to trade for Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Alex Ochoa only hours before Wednesday's nonwaiver trading deadline	3.12
Molina spent all season at TripleA Salt Lake before joining majorleague club July to replace his injured brother, Bengie	3.2
I feel bad for Jorge, he is good friend of mine, Bengie said	2.5
But they liked way Jose has played and they are giving him chance	3.5
I'm very excited we will be on same team for while	4.2
I just hope they keep me here,	3.0
I just hope they keep me here, Jose said	2.9
Ochoa took Fabregas' spot in roster, but Angels will have to clear another spot today to make room for Bengie	3.33
Infielder Jose Nieves is likely to be sent down, but since he is out of options, he would have to clear waivers before he could join TripleA Salt Lake	2.71
Not expected: Fabregas, who hit with no homers and RBI in games with Angels this season, said he was surprised and shocked to get traded from pennant contender to team games out in NL Central	2.75
Obviously I'm disappointed to go from team playing for first place to team that is not contending	1.6
I felt like I was big part of team I went through struggles last year and I wanted to be part of it in good times	3.3
In addition to Ochoa, Angels got minorleague catcher Sal Fasano	3.3
In return, Brewers got backup catcher Jorge Fabregas and players to be named later	3.14
In past week, Angels deemed outfield depth their biggest need, above adding reliever to bullpen	2.9

OLYMPIC JUDGING SCANDAL DEEPENS WITH ARREST OF RUSSIAN CRIME FIGURE	2.4
The complaint casts Salt Lake City figure skating scandal in more serious light than cronyism and voteswapping that have tainted increasingly troubled sport	2.75
The United States is seeking his extradition from Italy	3.0
The Italian authorities provided FBI with information from wiretaps of Tokhtakhounovember's home telephone, part of investigation into his criminal activities	3.0
The FBI said explicit conversations about scheme had been recorded between Tokhtakhounovember and his conspirators, and between him and Anissina, who was born in Russia and skated for France, and her mother	3.0
The FBI cited vivid conversation with Anissina's mother in which Tokhtakhounovember assured her that even if her daugusthter falls, we will make sure she is No	3.0
falls, we will make sure she is No	3.2
After Winter Olympics, French judge, MarieReine Le Gougne, was suspended by International Skating Union for not reporting pressure she said was put on her by Didier Gailhaguet, president of French Skating Federation, to vote for Russian pairs team	2.75
She later recanted and said that Canadian officials had pressured her	2.33
The ISU later suspended Le Gougne and Gailhaguet for years	2.7
The federal complaint did not describe possibility of wider conspiracy or any contact between Tokhtakhounovember, or his unnamed coconspirators, with Le Gougne	2.9
A Russian accused of being in organized crime was arrested in Italy on Wednesday on American complaint that he conspired to fix pairs figure skating and ice dancing competitions at recent Salt Lake Winter Olympics, which were dominated by sport's judging scandals	2.6
We have alleged no connection between this man with any officials other than with Russian federation officials,	3.0
We have alleged no connection between this man with any officials other than with Russian federation officials, James B Comey, U S attorney for Southern District of New York, said at news conference	3.0
He said that Tokhtakhounovember reached out to coconspirator, somebody connected to Russian Skating Federation, who did legwork for him	2.7
reached out to coconspirator, somebody connected to Russian Skating Federation, who did legwork for him	3.0
Maxwell Miller, Le Gougne's lawyer in Salt Lake City, said no evidence of organized crime influence came up in her suspension hearings before ISU I think this situation vindicates argument that we have made all along, he said	3.0
I think this situation vindicates argument that we have made all along,	3.0
Tokhtakhounovember, whose age was given by Comey as or , is major figure in international Eurasian organized crime, Comey said	3.0
major figure in international Eurasian organized crime,	2.9
Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and now Russian citizen, he is known as Taivanchik, or Little Taiwanese, for his Central Asian ethnic background	3.0
Comey said Tokhtakhounovember had residences in Italy: Forte dei Marmi, Rome and Milan	3.1
The complaint against Tokhtakhounovember's traces his contact with figure skating to , when he proposed to Gailhaguet creation of professional hockey team in Paris that would provide revenue for French Skating Federation	3.0
Gailhaguet and Anissina are not referred to by name in accompanying FBI agent's affidavit, but by their descriptions their identities are obvious	3.0
In return, Gailhaguet told FBI on Feb as Olympics were taking place, Tokhtakhounovember asked for Gailhaguet's help in renewing his French visa, which was about to expire	3.0
But when Gailhaguet sought guidance from French government official, he was told that Tokhtakhounovember's money is bad, affidavit said	2.62
Tokhtakhounovember's money is bad,	2.14
The federal complaint offers many details of alleged conspiracy, including excerpts from transcript of Italian wiretaps	2.89
On Feb , Italian wiretaps recorded Tokhtakhounovember's request to someone identified as another Russian mobster to get number of Russian Skating Federation official	3.0
is close to us he is good guy, he will do it	3.4
Tokhtakhounovember's action apparently came soon after he said he received phone call from mother of female ice dancer, presumably Anissina	3.3
The Russian, Alimzhan Tokhtakhounovember, who was arrested by Italian authorities at his resort home in Forte dei Marmi, appeared to have singular motivation for rigging competitions: getting visa to return to France, where he once lived	2.9
A week later, after Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze's pairs victory, mobsters spoke again	3.0
The second mobster expressed satisfaction with outcome of competition and suggested that Tokhtakhounovember could call ice dancer's mother or father and tell them everything will be OK	3.0
mother or father and tell them everything will be OK	3.0
He appears to be referring to Anissina	3.1
The second mobster added, Our Sikharulidze fell, Canadians were times better, and in spite of that French with their vote gave us first place	3.0
Everything is going way you need it	3.29
They also discussed coming judging in ice dancing, in which French and Italian teams were favorites	3.2
The second mobster said French pair had only judges, and of judges they needed to win gold medal is ours, and other our friends will give them	3.0
only judges,	2.7
Their concern for lining up more votes than they thought Italian ice dancers had may stem from Italian team's defeat of Anissina and Peizerat in world championships	3.1
But they seemed pleased that Russian pair's victory was achieved with French judge's vote	3.2
The French have nothing but ice dancing, second mobster said	2.64
Again, Tokhtakhounovember voiced his need to have his French visa extended, and he said Anissina had tried to help him but Gailhaguet had thwarted her	2.9
Also on Feb , week before ice dancing finals, Tokhtakhounovember told Anissina's mother in telephone call that Russian federation official had called me from America to assure that we are going to make Anissina Olympic champion	3.7
had called me from America	3.14
we are going to make	3.0
Olympic champion	3.4
He told her that Russian skating federation official will help he has or judges	3.0
will help he has or judges	3.1
On or about March , in conversation between Tokhtakhounovember and Anissina, she said she would have won event without his assistance because Russian judge did not vote for her and her partner	3.1
She also apologized for not calling to thank him earlier, but that Gailhaguet had forbidden her	2.9
was involved with results	3.0
He assured her that it was nonsense, but that Gailhaguet knows my name very well he tried to help me, and later he made stuff up to scare you so you would not connect me to him even more	2.7
The conversations seem to indicate familiarity between Tokhtakhounovember and Anissina	3.0
Tass, official Russian news agency, reported that Anissina attended ceremony in at Paris hotel honoring Tokhtakhounovember for his philanthropy	3.25
The federal prosecutor in Manhattan alleged in criminal complaint that Tokhtakhounovember had conceived and directed scheme with second man alleged to be in Russian mob and member of Russian Skating Federation to secure gold medal for top Russian pairs skaters and for top French ice dancers, of whom is Russian	2.56

The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain strong lead in chipmaking beyond personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold advantage	3.0
The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack highperformance segments of marchket,	3.25
IBM OPENS CHIP PLANT IN UPSTATE NEW YORK	3.43
An advantage to having semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N Y To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovemberations out of labs and into factory as fast as possible is crucial	3.0
What we call labtofab time should be as close to as possible,	3.0
What we call labtofab time should be as close to as possible, Kelly said	3.0
If our strategy were anything but to be on leading edge, we would have put plant in Asia	2.75
In brief speech, Samuel J Palmisano, IBM's chief executive, emphasized that it was important to make longterm investments despite current slump in technology business	3.1
To play to win in technology, you innovemberate and you lead,	3.2
In June, IBM announced that it was taking charge of more than against earnings	3.0
EAST FISHKILL, N Y IBM opened sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than to build and equip, largest single capital investment company has ever made	3.0
But Kelly said demand for advanced chips, like those produced at IBM's facility in Burlington, Vt, is strong	3.2
I need more capacity in that end of marchket,	3.11
I need more capacity in that end of marchket, he said, and this is factory is critical to meeting that growing demand	2.9
If IBM has miscalculated demand, it will suffer badly as both high operating costs and depreciation on huge capital investment for East Fishkill factory drag down earnings	2.56
But industry analysts said plant should be insulated from falloff in or few segments of semiconductor marchket	3.1
The factory is highly automated and designed to shift flexibly to produce many different kinds of chips to suit demand	3.1
The diversity is big difference with this plant,	3.2
The , squarefoot plant is testament to advanced manufacturing technology	3.6
The millimeter silicon wafers about size of standard pizza are shuttled around facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks	3.0
Throughout processing steps, which typically last days, wafers are not touched by human hands	3.1
The circuits etched into chips are less than thousandth width of human hair	3.0
Because each of hundreds of processing machines is selfenclosed, and essentially airtight, uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in previous generation of chip plants, which looked like space suits	3.17
The operators at East Fishkill factory wear light nylon uniforms, light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made of paper	3.11
but donuts are lot more costly here	2.3
Each wafer, holding hundreds of chips, is worth , to , apiece, depending on what insulation, circuitry and materials are used	3.2
The factory, which opens as computer chip business is in slump, is costly and risky move for IBM	2.86
But it is also expression of confidence by company that it can remain technology leader in highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and commitment that best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York	3.5
IBM is exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips	3.0

Black bean sauce is favorite seasoning	3.2
In Vietnam, bitter melon halves are stuffed with meat mixtures, such as ground pork with black mushrooms and cellophane noodles, then braised	3.1
Colin Spencer's Vegetable Book details intriguing Indian chapati in which bitter melon, seeds left intact, is sliced, parboiled, then mixed with lightly fried garlic and Indian spices, flour and yogurt	3.2
The mixture is fried like thick pancake and served, sliced, with rice, naan and other curries	3.0
THE PRODUCE BIN: Bitter melon	3.1
The Chinese and Indian varieties differ little in taste	3.0

She is in most active of levels available, but should need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within same complex	3.1
Julia, explains Hersh, made these retirement plans many years ago	3.1
She thinks it is selfish for people not to make arrangements for their old age in good time	2.44
But so far, age has been kind to ebullient Child	3.25
In phone interview couple of weeks ago, she reported with glee that surgery early this month to remove small cyst on her spinal cord had miraculously cleared up recent problems in walking: Turned out there is nothing wrong with my legs at all	3.3
So she can once again go shopping, buying whatever seems best on any given day	3.0
Though she had nice kitchen installed in her new home, Child said it is like ship's galley far cry from huge, kitchen Paul Child designed for their house in Cambridge	2.9
Back there, we always ate in kitchen, Child reminisced, I can not do that here	2.9
That means her entertaining has been curtailed, even though she still has active social life with many friends Childs made during winters spent in Santa Barbara	2.9

Contrary to what some restaurants and retailers tell their customers, U S government does not consider Chilean seabass to be endangered	2.89
But in some areas, seabass are being overfished	2.3
That is potentially problem because Chilean seabass are longlived species living as long as years and reproduce slowly, said Susan Buchanan, spokeswoman for federal government's National Marine Fisheries Service	2.27

They included support for marchine reserves and money for fisheries management reform	3.2

PRESCRIPTION PRIVILEGES MAKE SOME PSYCHOLOGISTS ANXIOUS	2.62
The APA has spent more than to help state psychological associations develop and lobby for such prescription privileges or RxP legislation	3.1
A total of state psychology associations have task forces dedicated to developing and lobbying for prescriptionprivileges legislation	3.0
The version endorsed by APA would license doctoberorallevel psychologists to independently prescribe psychotropic drugs after completing hours of classroom instruction in neuroscience, physiology and pharmacology, followed by months' supervised treatment of patients	3.0
Critics say that is not nearly enough compared with other prescribers, such as M D psychiatrists or nurse practitioners who have at least years' medical education and clinical experience	3.0
Neither Davison nor most other RxP opponents doubt efficacy of medications	3.0
Their greatest objection is to notion of turning psychology into prescribing profession	3.0

Karnes sat in his woodpaneled office in Quonset hut in middle of Great Salt Lake Desert, black telephone to his ear	2.8
Each year on Aug , I always think of Paul Tibbets and how he handled unbelievable responsibility, Karnes said	3.12
Karnes was personnel and classification officer	3.0
He was only captain, but he had been left in charge at Wendover day Tibbets surprised them by landing B, new plane no at Wendover had seen	3.12
Tibbets had just been ordered to organize combat force to drop bomb being developed by secret enterprise known as Manhattan Project	2.8
He was searching for remote installation to train bomber crews and support units in total secrecy	2.9
Tibbets instantly liked isolation and vast size of Wendover and surrounding Bonneville Salt Flats	3.3

Tibbets quickly returned to Wendover after that first visit to set up his headquarters	3.09
Almost overnight, Wendover became highsecurity base filled with offlimit areas covered in barbed wire	3.0
No was allowed to talk about what they saw or heard, even though most of th had no idea why they were there, except that Bs were being modified to carry heavy load	2.5

Where is authority?	2.8
Bs had gone ahead to check weather at Hiroshima and other possible bomb sites	3.0
other Bs left in intervals after Tibbets so their crews could take photos and drop devices to measure radiation and other effects of bomb	2.86

More shocking was city of Hiroshima, which was on fire and bubbling like tar	2.5
We were all appalled,	2.2
Back on Tinian, Karnes had gone to bed	2.9
But he did not sleep long	2.44
Someone woke him to say Gen Hap Arnold, chief of Army Air Forcesin Washington, was on phone and asking for him	3.0
Each time, Karnes said what he had to: Call Air Force headquarters if you do not believe me	2.9
Arnold told Karnes, Tibbets is going to be landing in to hours, and I want to give him Distinguished Service Cross, and it is your job to write up explanation	3.1
Tibbets is going to be landing in to hours, and I want to give him Distinguished Service Cross, and it is your job to write up explanation	3.11
I had no idea how you wrote up award	3.1

A yearof secrecy and hard work wasover	3.0
Today, Karnes is frustrated that some of his fellow historians, ones he calls revisionists, question wisdom and morality of bombings	2.5
Also, international competitors drew on large supply of very cheap labor	2.9
Jobs were scarce in other steelexporting countries, and labor laws were either nonexistent or allowed employers to pay much less for work	2.7
On worldwide scale, newer materials such as aluminum, plastic, and composites were beginning to substitute steel both at home and abroad	3.0
Steel demand worldwide was beginning to decemberline, and it affected both domestic and foreign companies	2.7
However, to American companies already suffering financial setbacks, outdated machinery, and fierce competition, this lack of demand was inconvenience they could not afford	2.3
Since this problem was national rather than local one, problems that were occurring in Youngstown were not unique	3.0
Youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by collapse of steel industry, but it was not alone	2.2
The problem was national one, involving many more mills and issues than Youngstown's alone	2.4
You just can not solve nationwide problem in single city	2.9
The decemberline of world steel marchket affected not just Youngstown but entire steel community in America	2.5
Trying to prop up city's mills was impossible when faced with depression that spread throughout entire industry	2.71
The Save Our Valley Campaign: Lack of Funds and Plans	2.5
Eventually, some religious leaders involved in Ecumenical Coalition joined forces within community members and former steel mill employees to create Save Our Valley Campaign	3.18
As name suggests, local leaders wanted to instill people of Youngstown with fierce sense of urgency, driving them forward to confront steel companies and owners and help secure future of region	3.11
The events that would follow this date known as Black Monday are seen by people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope	2.8
Marches, speeches, and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate Campaign and rally people	3.2
But Campaign was bogged down heavily by lack of proper funding	2.6
People outside of area had no personal investment in mills, and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of county to contribute funds	2.8
The lack of money proved to be crippling, because it prevented organizations involved from purchasing mills to run collectively	2.78
Without funds, Save Our Valley Campaign could do nothing major to help salvage city's dying economy	2.4
The Save Our Valley Campaign also lacked essential component: actual concrete plan	2.45
No seemed to know just how to go about fixing problems	2.3
People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization, but no could really fathom exactly how that would work; people of Youngstown were, after all, not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general	3.0
Without funds to drive efforts, or even real plan of action, Save Our Valley Campaign did more harm than good	2.6
In effect, it raised hopes of workers without having any real chance at saving anything	2.7
People became excited and waited for mills to reappear, but they never did	2.89
United Steel Workers of America was union representing Youngstown steel workers when closings hit	3.0
Initially many assumed that their union would take lead role in fighting for recovery of their jobs	3.0
However, it soon became clear that although local union leaders were prepared to fight, international branch was not	3.1
The higher levels of union became increasingly disassociated with Youngstown and its plight, attempting to shut out appeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening	2.4
No had ever seen shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before, and none of leaders of USWA, not even president Lynn Williams, knew what could be done	2.9
It was clear to everyone that economic fallout from this series of closings would be of worst in US history, and so without any real precedents union leaders were flustered	2.5
Besides incompetence, USWA had other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart: fear of socialism	2.5
Obviously union itself was not afraid of socialist action, but they worried that federal government might see efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism	2.8
If USWA supported efforts to revive mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of factories, then government and potentially other important people and institutions as well might begin to think that UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism	2.75
Regionalism	3.0
From its very first days Mahoning Valley has been area packed with small villages and hamlets	3.1
Youngstown is name of major city area, but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to casual viewer are indistinguishable from main city itself	3.0
Petitions, protests, rallies, collectivization, and even takeover of steel company's headquarters were all attempted in desperate movement by those in industry to preserve only source of employment that this town had	2.44
Boardman, Poland Township, Struthers, Lowellville, Warren, Lordstown, Canfield, Niles, and many other towns and districts are crowded around Youngstown see Figure	2.8
People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns septemberarate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town	3.0
However, although traffic is heavy between each septemberarate district, each area has its own distinct cultural ethnicity, educational system, heritage, history, and even food	3.1
For example, Struthers is poor town with large Slovak population, where education is generally better than in surrounding towns, but unemployment is much higher and pollution is widespread	3.0
Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist	3.0
blocks over finds Boardman, welloff township with reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools	2.7
Its residents are mainly Italian and Roman Catholic, with small concentration of Methodists on east side	3.0
With many more cultures, religions, and economic levels living in close proximity to another, curious phenomenon has overtaken area: regionalism	3.0
Each town, with their own identity, instills strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations, which dictates many habits, exchanges, and interactions between populations	3.1
Oftentimes this regionalism takes form of bizarre forms of hatred, with certain towns becoming sworn enemies of others	2.2
With so much regional tension, it became very hard for workers to unite under common cause, even that would save their jobs and their futures	2.62
Workers from Poland Township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from Campbell, and citizens of Struthers would become suspicious of people from Boardman, even if they were supposed to be working towards same thing	2.78
A lack of cooperation became crippling problem for movement, because no was willing to put aside regional differences to work together	2.75
In some instances, small companies would express interest in helping movement or in relocating their business in area, but because of regional pride no could ever agree where new businesses should relocate	2.88
In this way people of Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for new industrial or commercial lifebruarylood because of arbitrary arguments where goal was simply to protect regional pride	2.9
These wellintentioned efforts ultimately failed, leaving thousands with shattered dreams and distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind	2.13
Conclusion: The Aftershock and Significance of Black Monday	2.9
Black Monday was devastating blow to entire generation of people	2.0
The efforts to avoid catastrophe after fact were unsuccessful for main reasons: failure of international steel marchket, lack of funds and plans in initiatives such as Save Our Valley Campaign, refusal of USWA to support their local chapter out of ineptitude and fear, and absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope for brining in new companies	2.7
What happened in Youngstown may not seem significant on international or even on national level, and perhaps it is not	2.9
But to thousands of people living there, loss of mills was devastating event that sent shock waves through their economic, political, and social futures	2.6
Because of mills and their conspicuous absence, hundreds of people were uprooted, forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities	2.3
Hundreds more joined unemployment lines, or even began living on streets	2.63
The steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves, something which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on	3.1
Even though they eventually failed, fact that they tried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives and futures of their children	3.1
But why did brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive steel industry ultimately fail?	2.75
When examining area's history, culture, and economic situation we can identify main reasons: refusal of international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union's Youngstown branch, lagging international steel marchket, lack of clear, organized vision for individual initiatives such as Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in region, all contributed in some way to failure of workers and union leaders to save industry	2.63
Most importantly, problem in Youngstown was nationwide problem	2.5

During Civil War, Youngstown played vital role in supplying Union army with iron products	3.11
The Decline of Northeastern Ohio Steel Market: Why Did Attempts by Union Leaders and Concerned Citizens to Revive Steel Industry Ultimately Fail?	2.5
Youngstown also was major railway crossroads, due to its strategic position between Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York, and Chicago	2.89
In fact, More rail cars passed under Center Street Bridge major bridge in Youngstown per day than any other location in country	3.1
During th century, center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from far East Coast Massachusetts and Eastern Pennsylvania to Ohio Valley Pittsburgh regions of Northeast, including Mahoning Valley and Hanging Rock region of Ohio and Kentucky	3.0
By , Youngstown's population had grown to nearly , , which meant it had doubled in size over period	3.11
The town continued to prosper, driven by flux of immigrants pouring in with hopes of employment at mills	3.4
This prosperity continued until late s, when Great Depression hit area hard	2.62
Despite Congress of Industrial Organization's successful efforts to establish national steel workers' union, industry barely survived Depression years	2.7
Finally, outbreak of Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into fastpaced period of booming growth	3.3
Strikes racked town during forties, fifties, and sixties, and they were often long and bloody	2.6
This prohibited strikes and lockout, angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down	2.44
At same time, stricter governmental standards for environmental protection and growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and marchket American steel parts, and overeager shareholders in companies' stock were pushing for more and more of their share of pie	3.1
Most importantly, Youngstown's steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive	2.6
September , is date that few people in Youngstown, Ohio will ever forget	3.0
Black Monday and Crash of Steel Industry	2.7
Between and , total of mills were closed and approximately , jobs were lost countywide	2.4
Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in attempt to persuade powers that be to reconsider their statement	3.0
However, it was clear that, in words of USWA president Lloyd McBride, If you can not make buck, you get out of business	3.0
On that date Jennings Lambeth, president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, announced that most of steel company's Campbell Works would close	2.2
If you can not make buck, you get out of business	2.75
The closings meant end of Youngstown's only real industry, end of its population growth, and then end of economic progress	2.75
Without mills, people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas of country	2.8
Those that could afford to move did so; those that could not afford to move mostly ended up on streets	2.67
Without industrial or residential base, commerce shrank considerably	2.33
It was becoming increasingly clear that without industrial base provided by mills, city of Youngstown would soon become ghost town, inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape	2.4
The workers decemberided they needed to do something to save their city, and so they mobilized in variety of ways	3.22
Attempts to Save Mills	3.0
The very first thing that workers could do was to get up petition to stop shutdown, says Ed Mann, local union leader and organizer	2.9
The International chapter of USWA had much more lobbying power, but they refused to support local union members	2.86
The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure	2.5
Next, workers decemberided to form Ecumenical Coalition, organization of local religious groups which spearheaded attempt to reopen Youngstown works	3.14
Although for other cities this would simply be minor economic setback, for people of Youngstown and surrounding area, it meant disaster	2.43
Lykes ignored letters, so Coalition turned once again to federal government	2.75
Here, too, they were ignored	2.2
The Coalition had no proper funds to buy mills, so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as mills closed	2.7
Finally, following shutdown of US Steel's plant in , local union leaders congregated outside US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown	2.9
They invited local people and politicians to witness scene, then charged Headquarters and took it over	3.1
The workers stayed there until next day, when US Steel decemberlared that they were ready to talk about selling mill	2.78
Immediately after workers left building, US steel representatives told local union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing workers to purchase mill	2.63
All these efforts eventually came to nothing, and Youngstown's steel mills remained closed	2.25
In fact, American steel imports were beginning to outweigh exports	2.86
Wage hikes, although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers in US, made American steel far more expensive	2.56

In vividly told book, Ms Seltzer wrote about her AfricanAmerican foster brothers, Terrell and Taye, who joined Bloods gang when they were and	2.6

of first things I did once I started making drug money was to buy burial plot	2.6
It's like satire of satire	2.8
This is my favorite line in whole NYT article: Sarah McGrath, editor at Riverhead who worked with Ms Seltzer for years on book, said she was stunned to discover that author had lied	3.1
I want to write as others do: tale, set in our real world, of characters who might live therein, not citizens of some airy demesne beyond stars!	3.2
Allan sat down at his desk and pulled chair in close	3.0
People will read such stories; they are worth publishing	3.3
That is precisely why I must excise this malignant instinct!	2.6
Why do you write?	3.0
Why to earn living, I suppose	3.0
Why do you ask?	3.0
You choose to write rather than become fisherman or carpenter, though you face such difficulty	2.83
I would not be happy, thus septemberarated from it	2.2
Yes, I suppose could see it thus	3.0
But really, Nathan, your queer habits of conversation have reached new level	2.43
Ignoring statement, Nathan continued	2.8
Your writing is for you, Allan, not for publishers or some imagined audience	2.9
Your stories strike chord with deepest, most ancient stories of mankind, tales basic to humanity	3.2
You need not pander to what you imagine their wants are; speak, and they shall listen	2.9
Allan crouched over his desk once more, pen in hand and mind blank	2.7
He had filled his pen and raised it, nib descending towards paper, before sound came: gentle, persistent tapping of gnarled, primeval willow touching window with long, insistent fingers	3.0
His eyes awoke with passionate, determined flame, though only light came from glutted moon	3.0
Where before they had marchched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture	3.0
He continued long into night, until eldritch orb had sunk into waiting hands of willow, raised perpetually skyward	3.0
Arthur looked up from results of night's frenzied labors and looked Allan in eye	3.0
What is this?	2.89
he queried, indicating pages he held in his left hand	3.1
I decemberided that since I was not having much success with more traditional stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,	3.12
I decemberided that since I was not having much success with more traditional stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely, Allan replied, somewhat less selfassured than he had been previous night	2.7
Although concept was simple one, Allan thought it had potential	3.2
What in Gd's name could have possessed you to do such thing,	2.6
What in Gd's name could have possessed you to do such thing, cried Arthur, nearly raising his voice	2.3
After all I said day before, why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some selfindulgent fantasy?	2.6
He shook papers at Allan, raising them like belt above head of disobedient son	2.8
This is nothing but glorified Grimm's tale, miscarried child of Stoker, creation less fit to be published than to be told around open fire at hovel of some peasant!	2.22
He spoke last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur's throat	2.36
Besides, public liked good, simple romance	3.5
Do you hate modern system of literature?	2.8
Do you personally despise works Enlightenment or progress made since Shakespeare??	2.9
?	3.0
For moment, Allan could hardly do more than shake his head	3.0
No, of course not I	2.8
Then why,	2.55
do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble, this morbid, paganistic drivel?	2.44
Why do you disregard my warnings, my careful advice given in best of friendship and designed only to save you from sinking into this very type of corruption, this literary debauchery?	2.4
Perhaps this will be more saleable, he thought and began to write	3.3
Could you write decemberent tales with that willow at your window?	3.0
How could any writer accommodate edicts of popular literature with very forces of nature knocking upon his door?	3.0
Arthur looked down his nose at distraugustht author, viewing his complaint with pure disdain scantily concealed by veneer of politeness that animated construct that was Arthur Mason	2.8
A tree forced you to write this, my dear Mr Clemm?	2.7
I must admit, this seems farfetched, even by your standards even your Nathan might have difficulty believing you	2.8
They gazed at each other, lost in rapture of love based so deeply within their hearts that they had never seen it before	3.8
You do not know what this is like,	2.75
You do not know what this is like, said Allan, shaking his head	2.2
Nathan would understand completely	3.25
Even as he said it, Allan prayed that his statement was true	2.8
Very well, said Arthur; then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you	2.9
then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you	2.5
If you insist on abandoning me, I shall not hold you	2.3
Stunned, Allan slowly gathered up pages and placed them in order	2.7
He then turned and left through door opposite that Arthur had taken, making his way past his host's doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards Nathan's residence, several miles away	2.9
Opening side drawer, he took out piece of paper and his inkpot	3.0
At long last, Nathan reached end and set down his reading on table between them	3.0
Allan leaned forward unconsciously	2.63
What about Roger?	3.0
Allan exhaled and leaned back into chair, his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts	3.3
So,	2.9
So, he asked, you do not think it is waste of ink and paper, futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery?	2.8
she asked, knowing that answer no longer mattered	2.8
Heavens, no,	2.11
Heavens, no, said Nathan, aghast	2.1
This is of strongest works I've read in ages	3.8
It speaks to deepest storyteller's instinct within us all, yet is entirely original	3.1
Oh, they may rail against you at first; they may decemberry you as heathen or literary savage; but while those in power say such things, others will read your tales and see their true worth	3.22
Believe me when I say that you will be read century from now	3.1
Allan, though dubious as to that possibility, felt some temptation from compliment; mainly, it granted him encouragement he still needed	3.09
Nathan promised to show story to printer he knew and Allan left it with him, then walked home under spreading maples with smile lingering on his face	3.36
This is good, he thought, pausing to raise low light of lantern	3.2
He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right; although man was somewhat peculiar, he had both unimpeachable honesty and certain propensity for insight	3.0
Certainly, it was undeniable that stories had originality to them	3.0
His mind's strangest fruit had ripened at last, and he found taste less bitter than expected	3.5
These thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked long road home	2.8
It was evening, and sky burned orange in west when he neared home at last	3.33
Passionate, fiery colors filled western sky before him, though sun itself had reached trees and few dark clouds circled overhead	3.4
I'm almost done, and happy ending is just falling into place	3.7
As Allan drew closer, he distinguished new cloud, pillar rising directly ahead; road of smoke ascended in west, its source hidden by very hillock that concealed his house from traveler until had nearly reached its door	2.88
Allan's thoughts fled as one, scattering on breeze that scattered warning plume	3.0
He ran last distance, crested hill puffing to reveal Arthur below, walking to carriage parked before Allan's house as laborers wrapped great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto vehicle's roof	3.0
Arthur paused in door, looking up at Allan for moment; then he turned and shut door behind him	2.62
The driver snapped reins and set horses on	2.89
As they trotted forth, Allan's eyes remained trapped by carriage, following it up hillock and past himself	3.0
The heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows	3.0
He watched as carriage drew still more distant, horses' hooves still kicking up dust along roadway	2.8
When they had gone, he remained, stunned, until scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself	2.57
He turned to regard pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done	2.7
Rounding corner, he saw great bonfire	3.0
A mass of flaming wood stood before him, heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house	2.67
As he thought this, sinuous wind encircled house, slipping through walls to chill him	2.6
It was moment before he realized what else had changed: near wall, beneath his window, was stump with black and ancient bark	2.9
In thoughtless panic, Allan flew to stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto pyre	2.4
His thoughts were not of act's futility, nor even of nights spent tormented by twisted thing; instead, all that filled his mind was tree's constant presence in his life, growing with him and beside him, its persistent reminders that he had higher, truer things to write, simple beauty of great black tree for its own sake	3.25
His handfuls could do nothing to quench hewn, burning logs, but when night sky grew dark above him and fire dwindled to black ashes, tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish final embers	2.2
But he did not weep	2.82
Instead, he bethought himself of loss of tree; considered also Arthur's motivation and whether some good might not come of this, after all	3.0
The papers and lantern's flame trembled as thin fingers of great black willow rapped gently on Allan's window and wall like stranger knocking on his chamber door	2.78
Leaving circle of ashes, he stood and turned towards woods, in which it was his habit to walk when in pensive mood	2.6
He stepped slowly beneath branches, gust of wind stirring up ashes behind him in great, swirling eddy, burning brand that rose up and dispersed on winds as though it were willow's last breath	2.8
Allan wandered beneath trees for time, thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog, strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate	2.88
And without that torturous willow, he might be free to write whatever he saw fit	2.7
Perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind	3.11
He found himself along bank of low, wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current	3.12
As it turned to deeper woods, elder giants rose above him: beech, smooth bark graygreen pennant hoisted on slope and standing out between dark, cracked trunks of nearer trees; great pines, few magnificent specimens still bearing symbol of British King; towering black birch, leaves impossibly high above him	3.14
This was no stranger, however; twisted, ancient thing was older than Allan, its branches rapping on his window since his childhood	2.9
There was hardly enough room for his slim frame between trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal trespass	2.75
Emerging from between antediluvian trunks, Allan set his feet softly down onto carpet of needles and stopped	2.9
Before him, roots imbibing sweet water of stream, grew stand of black willows	3.2
Though elders' trunks fell and died, their children, first roots grown from very branches that now lay dead, continued unabated, continuous line from most ancient of their ancestors	2.5
Allan stumbled forward, jaw slightly slack, until his outstretched hands encountered rough bark of twisted, willow whose waists were each larger than Allan himself	2.6
After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in orange glow from lantern set back in desk's righthand corner	3.0
Its thin, drawn fingers framed bloated moon, whose eerie radiation now bathed room directly	2.8
Allan recalled himself and focused once more on incomplete page before him	2.8
In author's eye gleamed lantern's reflection or was it reflection?	3.1
For while lantern's spark shivered in chill breeze, this burn was steady and true as motion of its owner's pen, scratching out rhythm of willow's fingers	3.25
The frenzied writing ceased at last, author leaned back with slight sigh as if both exhausted and satisfied by his effort	3.38
After all that so near end, to lose control again	2.11
Come, darling,	3.44
Where I am to take you, need never think of those left behind	3.22
His pen cast forbidding line of shadow slanting across page, echoing inky darkness crouching in edges of lantern's struggling glow	3.0
They took their seats within car and his driver set horses trotting	3.0
For few yards, they kicked up dust along roadway; then they raised their hooves and took to air	3.14
She gaped, afraid but knowing that no harm would come to her by his hand	2.4
The New England woods disappeared, even greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted sky	2.46
Above them, Milky Way drew near as if stars themselves could be reached	3.4
Allan crushed page in his hand and hurled it at window	2.5
Damn you,	1.75
Damn you, he cried, will you never leave me be?	1.78
Shall I never finish story in peace?	2.5
He pounded his desk in vain, cursing foul muse that drove him	1.9
The next day, Allan sat on florally patterned chair in wellfurnished parlor	3.0
Cucumber sandwich?	3.2
In manner delicately balanced between somber and genial, he refilled their glasses	3.0
How is writing these days, my dear Mr Clemm?	3.38
Perfectly dreadful, my dear Mr Mason,	2.5
I had perfect story in my pages; my hero returned home and reclaimed his love, I nearly had it tied together before	3.7
Before?	3.1
Before that blasted impulse came over me and I started writing like Edgar Poe though most recent was not so morbid as my many others, thank Heaven	3.12
Arthur's face assumed longsuffering aspect of authoritative exasperation	2.37
It's far from'penchant,' Arthur	2.9
The Black Willow	2.89
Arthur grimaced at vivid description	2.6
I'm sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption	2.6
I know, Allan replied, but how am I to do that?	2.8
but how am I to do that?	2.7
You know I do not wish to make my stories thus; but it is my nemesis, confronting me anew at every turn!	2.37
Arthur raised critical brow	2.4
Every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal; and believe me, Allan, you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish	2.71
Allan unfolded another page, this crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right	3.0
It is true,	3.0
that I would not dream of submitting of these corruptions of literature to any publisher	2.44
I've even tried rewriting corrupted sections, but once my characters have gone down that road, nothing can recall their former life	2.63
My prodigal inkblooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along proper road	2.91
If only you would restrain this morbid impulse of yours, you might write something really worth reading	2.83
It's hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in refined world of print, like surly foreigner among genteel crowd	2.6
Allan hung his head, holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees	2.38
His hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night, and his clothing had rumpled look as if, by mere proximity, it had taken on aspect of his weariness	2.3
I would drive it out,	2.9
I would drive it out, he said softly, but I fear for what would remain	2.4
but I fear for what would remain	2.25
Perhaps you require rest from writing,	2.88
You might find that some time in honest occupation would ground you somewhat, improve your disposition	3.12
Perhaps it would,	3.12
Perhaps it would, Allan replied, rising and vainly straightening his suit	2.67
So dear friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home,	3.57
So dear friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home, he said	3.78
I hope soon to see you in better sorts	2.9
They parted and Allan made his way pensively from Arthur's gate	3.0
He walked wheelruts, hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust	2.86
Some quartermile from Arthur's gate, he halted, confronted by halloo	3.0
he called out to empty road	2.5
I had hunch you would be at Arthur's today,	3.2
I had hunch you would be at Arthur's today, said Nathan, so I thought I'd wait here for you	3.2
so I thought I'd wait here for you	3.3
Nathan's lanky frame, dressed in loose, tan jacket, fit into branch like elegant skeleton	3.0
His hair fell loosely across face that seemed always to have knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface, infusing his body with rakish energy	3.1
So, Allan,	3.0
So, Allan, said Nathan, unfolding and lowering his legs to roadside, how goes life for quintessential American author?	3.0
I would not know,	2.67
I would not know, replied Allan dryly, before continuing in another tone entirely	2.73
I destroyed another story last night, Nathan	2.3
Leaning against his tree, Nathan shook his head	2.9
You mean, finished another story	3.0
Yes, it is finished!	3.8
Never again shall it see rosyfingered dawn!	2.8
Nathan, you have read these abominations of mine	2.57
You know just as well as I that they have no future, no potential	2.4
Allan reviewed troops, all prepared to disembark, their task to form tale of young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend bride tobe, thus upsetting apple cart of his life's plan, clarified of course by his very time away from her he loved best	2.7
At best, they are faery tales; at worst, expeditions into macabre realms no healthy mind need ever see	2.67
So instead, you would write what?	2.88
Something saleable; something worth reading, worth writing!	3.62
On sunny Sunday afternoon, waiting list was hour long	2.38
After hemming and hawing and assessing my food stash contents: saltines , I decemberided to go for it anyway	3.0
By time I got to Asheville, I was nearing end of my journey and bottom of my wallet	2.67
By time I finally got seat at counter, I was starved	2.5
It took me about seconds to pick out Charleston Chicken Sandwich: grilled marchinated freerange chicken breast on sourdough with melted havarti, romaine lettuce and cranberry mayonnaise	3.33
grilled marchinated freerange chicken breast on sourdough with melted havarti, romaine lettuce and cranberry mayonnaise	3.2
Cranberry?	3.0
Havarti?	3.0
Yes, I could dig it	3.6
While I waited for food, I checked out back of store where Tupelo Honey Cafe hawks their homestyle wares: preserves, pickles, salsa, honey, tshirts, aprilons and all sorts of miniadvertisements for restaurant	3.3
I've visited plenty of farmtofork restaurants, and this may be best I've seen at selfmarchketing	3.6
There's nothing wrong with it: food in those jars is probably delicious, though I question whether tupelo honey had to come from Florida or if it is produced locally	3.0
Some of that is surely due to good marchketing, but real reason for its popularity is this:	3.0
That sandwich was so good, I found myself eating slower and slower with each bite to savor it more completely	4.0
The potatoes were light and ungreasy; flavors were perfectly balanced; chicken was juicy and rich; and let us be honest here, I'm always happier eating dead animals when I know they have lived good life	3.2
I will never forget you	3.0
I stopped eating halfway through, not because I was full	2.71
On another topic, I made discovery there in Tupelo Honey Cafe, which I'd like to share with you now	3.2
If you are going to busy restaurant and want great service, bring camera	3.1
But	2.9
Now, I'm not saying service before my cameraflash was bad, because it was awesome	3.8
But wow, it sure improved once I appeared to be some sort of food critic or travel writer	3.1
Which, it just so happens, I am	3.1
I can not guarantee it will work, but I personally will do it againand probably back it up with stellar review, just like I've given Tupelo Honey Cafe	3.14
Everybody wins	4.0
Okay, that is it!	2.8
I could talk about Asheville for weeks, but it is time to move on	3.12
So I checked their website, and instantly fell in love:	3.73

It started in , when Andrew would ride around town pulling bikes out of dumpsters	3.0
He started hosting work parties with friends in his backyard, teaching them to fix their bikes and helping them get started riding	3.25
Slowly but surely, circle grew and Andrew's backyard parties became weekly workshops	3.0
When Andrew decemberided to leave town for few years' schooling in NYC, friends and cohorts took over operations	3.1
These days it is established club, run by volunteers and donations, turning trashed bikes into treasures	3.2
Its influence now includes legitimate downtown storefront; sister shop in Albany Albany Bicycle Coalition ; movie screenings and procycling political events; and dedicated core crew that keeps everything rolling	3.1
TBR's customers run gamut, from businessmen to street kids to college students to families	2.9
This group understands value of bicycle: more than just transportation, bike is statement against fossil fuels	3.1
More than toy, it is equalizer that allows poor kids to ride with rich	3.25
More than hobby, it is way of traveling through world that lets you interact, use your muscles, breathe fresh air all for cost of free dumpster bike	3.2
Remember when you got your first bike?	3.3
When I visited TBR shop, it was packed with frames, wheels, gears, chains, handlebars, kids, and anarchist art space is being donated by some supporters who are also anticapitalist activists	3.0
TBR hosts workshops twice week	3.14
Tools are available, and volunteers will help with advice and knowledge	3.2
Was it Christmas present, or maybe birthday gift?	2.9
Parts can be had for pittance, and you can pick out your own bike from stacks and racks of machines filling space	3.11
The main focus of TBR, however, is not selling bikes	3.0
The idea is to give people workspace and teach them how to maintain their own bicycle	3.3
All around me, college students and bike punks tinkered with their machines	3.0
An older man asked for tips on tuning his racer	3.0
A young kid came in to say his last bike was stolen and he needed new and, despite Andrew's stern reprimand that he could not just walk in every week and leave with free bike, he did just that	3.0
A dad came in with his kids, all of whom left with snazzy rides but first, they all sat down and worked on their new wheels together	3.38
I love what you do,	4.2
I have whole bunch of bikes to give you	3.4
See, ultimately TBR is about more than just bicycles	3.33
It's about building community, and triggering quiet but inexorable social movement	3.0
This is not world's first bike collective; in fact it is only of many that have stealthily sprung up around America	3.1
Save World, Ride Bike visit to Troy Bike Rescue	3.2
These collectives are not waiting for change to happen: they are creating it through small, positive, peaceful actions	3.2
You too can change world: all you have to do is ride bike	3.3
Fall is here, which in most places means great riding weather	3.3
What are you waiting for?	3.0
So pick up, and ride it to end of your block!	3.3
Then keep going!	3.17
Even if your life requires wheels, you can use bike for local errands	2.9

Tell store owner what you like, and see if he will carry it	3.11
Now you are changing world	3.75
On weekends, instead of driving to park, hop on your bike and go exploring	3.5
Or, if you are gym buff, trade workout for bike ride	3.1
Unless you live on major highway, odds are you can ride straight from your front porch to someplace interesting	3.2
It's cheaper, and much better for local flora fauna	3.3
Then think of it this way: by riding your bike instead of driving your car, you are reducing your consumption of fossil fuels	3.3
You can even calculate money you save on gas, and keep it in jar for rainy day	3.5
Cycling is thing of past: sport, hobby, but rarely mode of transportation	3.0

In Troy, New York, I met Andrew Lynn	3.0
David's dedicated and inspired agrarian, whose passion for farming keeps him optimistic	3.37
But farming on Outer Cape is sort of Sisyphian challenge that can wear anybody out	2.9
Without fertilization, it deteriorates shockingly fast	2.5
David points out patch of sand with thin strip of fertile loam along edge	3.0
Last season it was fertile veggie bed but it was left unfertilized as experiment	3.12
This is what happens, David says	2.75
You have to keep feeding it organic material, or it turns back into sand	3.0
Read about death carnage in shell shop, find out about ecofriendly food scene, look at pretty pretty sunset, or continue on	3.37
This plot was test run, left untended for single season	2.8
Last year's rich loam is now useless sand	2.3
The Outer Cape is really just spit of sand but still, farmers lived here for generations	3.0
How?	3.0
Salt marchsh hay	3.0
salt marchsh haying	2.89
Salt marchsh hay has no weed seeds, and it does not compact as heavily as other types of hay	3.1
This makes it excellent and bountiful source of compost, and it was used for generations as soil enricher	3.7
But haying had to happen regularly, says David: There's so much oxygen in this soil, any added compost gets burned up in weeks	2.62
There's so much oxygen in this soil, any added compost gets burned up in weeks All nutrients get depleted	2.7
All nutrients get depleted	2.37
The only way to keep things going here is to keep steady flow of compost coming in	3.1
That means truckloads of hay, and that means lot of work	2.8
Last year, David and Arthur brought in semi truck loaded with leaf mulch	3.0
Not longterm plan	2.75
Meanwhile, in Tourist Town USA	3.0
David DeWitt does not look like farmer	2.6
The Provincetown farmers marchket has lovely produce, but little of it was grown on Cape	3.0
Provincetown's official population of , supports tourism industry that serves millions of visitors each year	3.14
City folk marchvel at quaint charms of Cape, its idyllic beauty and simple pleasures	3.8
And then they go out to eat	3.0
Even if tourists were interested in sustainable food they totally do not care , they would be hard pressed to find locallysourced meal	2.4
With his long hair, scruffy beard and tshirt, he would fit in more at Phish show than behind plow	3.1
You can not squeeze blood from stone, and you can not get big vegetable crops from sand dunes	2.4
End of story	2.88
David is not giving up in fact, he is got plans and ideas to refashion North Truro's farming community	2.9
David is not alone: he is got support and companionship of growing group of gamechangers	3.12
If young farmers and foodies of Truro can organize, they might just be able to get local agriculture back on its feet	3.22
Their main opponent?	3.14
The tourism and real estate industries, which insist upon turning every arable inch of Cape into somebody's backyard	2.82
The same population that would consume food produced here is actively inhibiting its production	2.4
But appearances are decembereiving, and David's comfy mien belies passion that is influencing culture of northern Cape Cod	2.88
No surprise there	2.8

These archetypes seem different to me than other'trends'	3.2
All you can do is hope you bat and that when you fail, you fail fast	2.8
Ahh, classics	3.88
If you broaden your scope bit, I think it would be difficult to find time over last years or so when any of these archetypes did not have level of bubbling popularity via books, comic books, tv, movies, video games, music	2.89
If all you are looking at is or content categories maybe it looks like they are dead, but they may be flourishing elsewhere, and like virus they are just waiting for new host to carry them to mainstream	2.8
'trends'	3.0
Publishers, producers, editors, TV execs, they all have to calibrate their decemberisions based on so many factors, and yet even with access to sophisticated data it often comes down to human factors	3.1
