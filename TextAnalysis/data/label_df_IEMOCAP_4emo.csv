80.36,90.87,Ses05M_impro08_M009,neu,3.0,3.5,3.0,Ses05M,"Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished."
90.88,96.92,Ses05M_impro08_M010,neu,3.0,3.0,3.0,Ses05M,"Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on."
