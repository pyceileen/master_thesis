As for claim about his success as comptroller, where he controls state pension funds, there is no disputing funds' growth during his terms, but some critics say it had more to do with buoyancy of stock marchket in s than skilled management	3.0

Moore presents most important part of speech to back up this and ignores fluff	3.1
This is naive to extreme Heston would not be president of NRA if he was not kept up to date on most prominent cases of gun violence	2.6
we wanted to let NRA know that we have not forgotten about Kayla Rolland	2.9
Why did Moore, masterful deveiver, not edit this sequence out?	2.7
You accuse Moore so often of changing chronology, yet you have no problems changing it yourself	2.78
Perhaps best example of paranoia surrounding Moore's film is your subessay Is end of Heston interview itself faked?	2.8
Virtually every child psychologist knows that motherchild bonding is essential for development of empathy and social abilities, awareness of consequences of one's actions, and learning of conflict resolution by nonviolent means	3.11
Even official quoted by Moore blames welfare to work program, knowing full well that drug issue is red herring	2.7
Not surprisingly, guncite, too, compares data from different years as I know from personal experience, it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology	2.71
The gun control movement, on other hand, distracts from real causes of violence poverty, paranoia, war on drugs and antisexuality	3.0
He asks us to look at what I, foreign citizen, was able to do at local Canadian WalMart	3.12
Heston's allegedly implied racism	2.71
Heston's answers in interview were evasive and unhelpful	2.2
The most shameful part of ongoing attacks against Moore is that these answers have been all but ignored by his critics	2.5
Interactive fiction like video games, on other hand, presents violence in narrative context, which may very well desensitize participants to said violence, but no causative link has ever been proven	2.9
But perhaps campaign against Moore is really motivated by another reason	3.0
Critics have stated that this scene was staged , but in bank interview, official tells Moore that bank has its own vault storing about weapons at any given time	3.0
This sounds more like later correction for public relations purposes, but of course nobody questions bank claims when they can be used against Moore	2.75
The only thing that Moore compressed is timeframe	3.0
This is plausible but entirely irrelevant for movie, which already makes it quite clear that background check is being performed	2.9
The dialogue goes as follows:	3.0
It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most slightly misleading implication, but in doing so, they themselves have, unlike Moore, made many incorrect claims	2.8
First, from my cold, dead hands part: This is used by Moore as visual citation to introduce Heston	2.82

To ease Antie's onboard memory requirements and processing capabilities and to make all rest of pseudocode easier for reader to understand , I propose few global variables and subroutines	3.11
For simple start, forward cruise function will merely take in double integer representing speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed	3.0
Note that portion of this subroutine does run on schema basis:	3.0
Unfortunately, as of yet, no robot has managed to fool human for more than few seconds, and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society	2.6
Antie will attempt to determine tasks of other ants by sensing only nalkene levels	3.0
The second behavior, patrolling, involves subbehaviors: nest patrolling and trail patrolling	3.0
It is therefore reasonable to assign constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling	3.0
Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for short distance before returning to nest to idle for few minutes and exit again	3.1
It would also keep track of whether last rotation was clockwise or counterclockwise	3.0
Of course, what makes Antie innovemberative robot is taskswitching between these larger behaviors	3.1
To remind reader, this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create limited taskswitching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling	3.0
The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as function of successful foragers' returns with great accuracy by Schafer, et al , and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to nest does support theory that returning successful foragers have effect on activation of new foragers Gordon,	3.2
Conclusion	3.0
Antie will also feature skirt of bump sensors, sonar detectors and chemical emitters, including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging	3.11
Sensors	3.0
In order to inform itself about its environment, Antie will need number of sensors	3.0
Therefore when considering indigenous revitalization movements which began in th century Latin America, impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and nature of identity of peoples themselves is key	3.1
In contrast, Colombian indigenous groups are divided to extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued, but serves to split population, both between groups and within groups themselves	3.0
The differences between cosmovision in Spanish and indigenous languages are great, leading to difficulty of governing in Spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought	3.0
In Guatemala, they are largely comprised of conflict between poverty and progress; panMayan movement must meet dual trials of establishing positive identity within Mayan population itself and legitimacy in legal and political arenas in order to gain policy reforms and codified rights in law	2.9
Guerrilla warfare has since become part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples	2.4
This is similar to situation of Guatemala: government felt it needed to battle communism, armed and dangerous menace within , plunging country into civil warfare in s and continuing through s Warren :	2.9
The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with development of indigenous revitalization movements	2.8
of most dominant and easily noted factors is language	3.0
It often stands in conflict with AICO, its Guambiano counterpart Jackson :	2.75
The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since precolonial times; therefore any coalition between advocacy groups is tenuous at best Rappaport :	3.0
In s rhetoric of cultural diversity was picked up Colombian media, and subsequently entered consciousness of greater metropolitan public, thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as whole	2.7
Or massive biochemical attack!	2.8
And I think this is what they are waiting for	3.2
So you end up fighting entire population	2.7

Although motivic relationship between Introduction and first theme of exposition smooth transition, nearly every other element changes when first theme appears	3.0
The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to listener that introduction is over	2.9
As we will later see, this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in recapitulation	2.86
Example illustrates this structure	3.0
Wilson claims that C and E are local dominants to F in this first section of exposition	3.0
This creates both smooth transition to second theme and strong sense that new section is beginning, combination that is generally rather difficult to forge	3.0
While Wilson rightly identifies resultant set of measures as Z , identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we out that this is simple extension of intervallic sequence , , from original motive	3.0
This section returns to calm simplicity and tempo of second section, though apart from affect there are no references to that section	3.0
The second and fourth entrances of fugato subject are transposed up perfect fifth, but first note is B rather than C, which allows Bart to remain in this pentatonic set and also to reinforce B as tonal center	3.0
Both B and A are chromatic neighbors to A, which intensifies arrival on A, and brings out fact that appearance of A continues largescale wholetone descent that has been left stranded on B for entire development section	3.0
In fact, chord progression of first measures of Example can be thought of tonally as IviV in F major, while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major conspicuous A in measure easily brings doubt to this interpretation , we can certainly say that minor flare of beginning has been replaced by major flare here in recapitulation	3.0
To begin with, movement is in F	3.0
Beginning with exposition, largescale progression of tonal centers is wholetone descent from F to F, represented by stemmed notes in Example , while Introduction ascends from C to F through D shown as D and E in graph in quasibass Anstieg	3.29
The middle pitch of descent, B, acts as dominant to F, based on its symmetrical division of wholetone scale and fact that second theme appears in B in exposition	3.0
Our analysis will focus instead on relating foreground activity to overarching background structure	3.0
The perfect fourth in fact generates much of motivic and harmonic material of entire movement, and its importance is immediately evident in Introduction with opening bass motive	3.12
For this reason white walls are favored over colored ones for both galleries and architectural spaces	3.13
Thus said, use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was way for new bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from decemberadence of upper class and vulgarity from low	3.0
In prevailing styles of European bourgeoisie, there long survived tendency to limit use of color, with strong emphasis on what are generally thought of as non colors, such as white, black and gray	2.9
Another reason why it is believed that bourgeoisie took preference in black and white is because of Victorian sobriety of age and their obsession with purity and cleanliness	3.0
It is source of its profits Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas	3.25
At same time in our modern society, color has been seen as external threat to be purged from enlightened mind and space	2.9
colorlessness needs color in order to for full aesthetic experience to take place	3.1
color is seen as corrupting, intoxicating, disorienting and in art, has come to be associated with vulgar and kitsch	2.56
color rests on surface of object, it is superficial, cosmetic and therefore decembereptive since it hides true nature of that thing	2.8
For Charles Blanc color also represents kind of ruination color for him signifies mythical savage state out of which civilization, nobility of human spirit, slowly, heroically, has lifted itself but back into which it could always slide	3.14
It is descent in way it makes lose consciousness and enter into physical world of desire, and to desire is to lose control over oneself	3.4
Thus, began cult of black and white	3.0
The use of white is therefore decemberisive for bodily appearance of space	3.0
The first evening, students most from my college, from another gathered in shrine room, sitting crosslegged on cushions as we listened to Khenpo Kalsang introduce Tibetan Buddhist philosophy	3.08
If you believe selfcontrol is malleable but limited, you will set fewer goals	2.73
They propose that people with high selfefficacy people who believe that failure is result of insufficient effort, and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistence will achieve more of their goals than people with low selfefficacy, who tend to view failure as result of deficient ability, and thus may simply give up	3.0
The study was testing whether belief in unlimited, malleable selfcontrol would result in most resolutions, and indeed, this is what was found	3.0
But if participants believed in unlimited selfcontrol, selfefficacy had no effect; participants achieved just as many goals regardless, and people who set more resolutions were marchginally more likely to succeed	3.09
Mukhopadhyay Venkatarmani realize that their research does not directly look at relationship between lay theories of selfcontrol and beliefs about one's own amount of selfcontrol and selfefficacy, and propose this as area for future study	3.0
