# master_thesis
This repository contains the source code for my master thesis in speech emotion recognition. The project consists of three parts: 

1. Text model that conducts sentiment analysis of the speech.
2. Audio model that predicts emotions directly from the speech.
3. Ensemble model that combines the previous two to make the final prediction.

To run (train) the models, execute the files with `main` prefix.
