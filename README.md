# master_thesis
This repository contains the source code for my master thesis in speech emotion recognition. The project consists of three parts: 

1. **Text model** that conducts sentiment analysis of the speech.
2. **Audio model** that predicts emotions directly from the speech.
3. **Ensemble model** that combines the previous two to make the final prediction.

To replicate training the models, run the files with `main` prefix in the text model and the audio model folders, and `ensemble` files in the ensemble model folder.
